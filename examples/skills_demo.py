"""Skills: a procedure you wrote once, loaded only when it applies.

Builds two skills in a scratch directory, points an agent at them, and
asks a question that matches ONE of them. Watch three things:

* the ROSTER in the system prompt -- two lines, ~25 tokens each. That is
  the whole standing cost of having skills available.
* the model calling ``load_skill`` on its own. Nothing in the question
  says "skill"; the description is what earns the call.
* the second skill never loading. You do not pay for what does not apply.

Add ``--delegated`` to run a third skill that declares ``mode:
subagent``: its ``allowed-tools`` stop being advice and become a fence,
enforced by building the child's registry from exactly that list.

# Writing a changelog entry

House format, and it is picky on purpose:

1. Newest entries go at the TOP, under `## Unreleased`.
2. One line per change: `- <area>: <what changed, present tense>`.
3. The area is the package path without `src/` (`tools/glob`, not
   `src/yantra/tools/glob.py`).
4. No issue numbers, no author names. `git log` already knows both.

Example: `- tools/glob: match hidden files when the pattern asks for them`

# Triaging a bug report

1. Reproduce before reading code. A bug you cannot reproduce is a
   question, not a bug.
2. Classify: wire format, loop invariant, tool behaviour, or UI.
3. Name the invariant it violates, if any. "It feels wrong" is not one.

# Surveying a directory

You are reading, not changing: you have no write tools and no shell.

1. `list_dir` first. Do not read a file before you know its neighbours.
2. Read only what you need to say what each file is FOR.
3. Report in the format you were given. Stop when the question is answered.
