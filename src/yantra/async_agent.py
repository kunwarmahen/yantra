"""The agent loop, event-loop edition -- the async twin of ``agent.py``.

    user message -> model -> [tool calls? -> execute -> results] -> ... -> final answer

Why this file exists (and why it is a TWIN, not a rewrite): the sync
loop is sequential at the model boundary no matter what color its
functions are, so converting it buys nothing for ONE conversation. What
it buys is MANY conversations: one event loop driving K independent
AsyncAgents concurrently, each holding its own history -- the shape
batch evals and multi-session servers actually want.

The rules are byte-identical to the sync loop; only the plumbing is
awaited:

* ERRORS ARE DATA. Tool failures become ``is_error`` results the model
  reads and recovers from; the loop cannot be crashed by a tool.
* THE HISTORY INVARIANT: every tool_call id gets a matching result
  before the next request -- on EVERY exit path, including iteration
  caps and task cancellation mid-turn or mid-batch.
* GATES SEQUENTIAL, EXECUTION PARALLEL. Permission gates may prompt y/n
  on the one shared terminal, so they run one at a time; approved calls
  then fan out via ``gather`` and yield in submission order -- capped at
  ``max_parallel_tools`` RUNNING tasks. The semaphore lives INSIDE each
  worker coroutine: every call still gets a task immediately (gather
  starts them all), only simultaneous EXECUTION is bounded. Tasks don't
  pay thread cost, but a 10-wide bash batch saturates the machine just
  the same -- leases prevent races, the width cap prevents saturation.
* CANCELLATION IS NOT LOSS. Cancelling mid-batch mirrors the sync
  Ctrl-C story exactly: ``to_thread`` workers cannot be interrupted, so
  the batch is joined, REAL results recorded ("the work happened"), and
  the exception propagates with history left resumable.

Deliberate duplication, documented: the loop body visibly repeats
``Agent.run_streaming``'s shape instead of unifying both behind a clever
driver. Sync and async control flow cannot share a generator's spine,
and a dunder-protocol abstraction would hide the two things this
project exists to teach -- where the await points ARE, and how the
invariant survives cancellation in each world. The leaf logic (event
folding, compaction arithmetic, truncation) IS shared.
