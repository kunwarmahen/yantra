"""The permission gate -- how a harness asks a human before acting.

A gate is just ``Callable[[PermissionRequest], bool]``. Keeping it a
plain function (not a class hierarchy) is deliberate: the CLI supplies
one that renders a rich y/n/e prompt; tests supply lambdas.

Every dangerous call produces EXACTLY one gate invocation, and whatever
it answers becomes data: denied calls turn into ``is_error`` ToolResults
the model can read and react to ("the user said no, try another way"),
never into exceptions.

Approve-with-edits: a gate may REPLACE ``request.arguments`` before
answering True (amend the bash command, fix the path). The agent loop
notices the swap (identity check) and adopts the edited dict as the
call's arguments -- so what runs is what was approved, edits included.
``summarize`` lets an editing UI re-render the preview for the amended
args without knowing anything about the tool.
