"""Durable sessions: the transcript survives process death.

SQLite (book ch21's choice) with VERSIONED checkpoints: every save
appends a row, nothing is updated in place. Cheap on disk; any prior
version stays loadable for debugging, and a crashed save can never
corrupt the previous good state -- that is what "durable" means here.

What we persist is deliberately small because of one design invariant:
history is ALWAYS resumable at prompt boundaries (the
invariant), so there is no such thing as saving mid-tool-call state.
No idempotency ledger is needed -- a saved session contains zero
outstanding tool_call ids by construction.

Payload shape (JSON inside checkpoints.payload):

    {"format": 1,
     "provider": "anthropic",        # rebuilt via get_provider on load
     "model": "...", "system": ..., "max_iterations": 25,
     "total_usage": {"input_tokens": ..., ...},
     "history": [{"role": "user",
                  "content": [{"kind": "text", "text": ...}, ...]}, ...]}

Blocks serialize with an explicit ``kind`` discriminator and restore
via match/case dispatch -- never guesswork. ThinkingBlock signatures
are opaque strings; they round-trip byte-exact or thinking-assisted
tool loops will 400 after a /load.

    from the package, which may have been edited since the checkpoint was
    written, and a restore that quietly reinstates last week's system
