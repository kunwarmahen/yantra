"""Where bash actually runs -- the pluggable sandbox protocol.

Book-inspired (agent-harness-book ch14), with one deliberate step
beyond it: the book ships only a dev-grade subprocess fallback behind a
``ToolSandbox`` protocol and waves at containers for production. This
machine HAS bubblewrap and unprivileged user namespaces, so the
production-shaped backend is real, not aspirational.

Two implementations behind one protocol:

* ``SubprocessSandbox`` -- today's behavior exactly (Popen in the
  workspace, own process group). Confinement is CONVENIENCE, not
  security: bash can cd anywhere and reach the network. This is why
  unsandboxed bash is permission-gated.
* ``BwrapSandbox`` -- bubblewrap: network OFF (--unshare-net), its own
  pid namespace (--unshare-pid), scrubbed environment (--clearenv),
  host filesystem mounted READ-ONLY except the workspace. A command
  that "escapes" finds /usr read-only, no route to the internet, and
  an env without your API keys.

GATES DECIDE, SANDBOXES CONTAIN (the two layers stay orthogonal): the
sandbox bounds the blast radius of an APPROVED call; it never decides
approval itself. The shipped bridge is ``trust_sandbox`` -- a gate
decorator that auto-approves bash ONLY while it is genuinely confined,
so autonomous builds can run without --yolo when bwrap is available.

      -- the toolchain (bash, python, git...) runs from READ-ONLY mounts;
      writes to anywhere outside the workspace fail at the syscall layer.
    * NOT binding /etc wholesale on purpose: inside a user namespace our
      fake root maps onto files owned by real root, so a careless whole-/etc
      mount could make shadow-style files readable. Bind the few bits
      dynamic linking and timezones need instead.
    * ``--unshare-pid`` -- the command sees only its own process tree AND,
      when we SIGKILL bwrap, the kernel kills the namespace's init, taking
      every child with it. The orphan-escape bug class from notes/04 dies
      here structurally, not by careful signal plumbing.
    * ``--unshare-net`` -- loopback only. Exfiltration needs egress.
    * ``--clearenv`` + explicit --setenv -- the allowlist env from
      :func:`_child_env`, rebuilt inside the namespace.

    Write semantics OUTSIDE the workspace (verified live): unmounted
    host paths don't exist ("No such file or directory"); paths under
    the mounts we DO create (/etc's cache anchor, /tmp) accept writes
    into an EPHEMERAL private tmpfs that vanishes when the call ends --
    they never reach the host. Either way the model must treat the
