"""Failover across providers -- opening-only, like retry, but across SPACE.

Retry (``retry.py``) fixes TIME problems: same place, later moment.
Fallback fixes PLACE problems: same moment, different backend. They
compose (each adapter retries its own opening first; only after a
backend exhausts its budget does failover even look at the next one),
and neither duplicates output, because both obey THE STREAMING RULE:

    once a single event has reached the caller, the exchange is
    COMMITTED -- replaying it means duplicate tokens in someone's
    terminal. Failover therefore happens only when a provider failed
    BEFORE delivering its first event.

What counts as "worth failing over":

* YES -- provider-side trouble where ANOTHER PLACE may genuinely differ:
  AuthError (the next key may be valid), RateLimitError, 5xx
  ProviderError, connection-level httpx.TransportError.
* NO  -- request-shaped failures: the SAME bytes are about to be sent to
  the next backend too. ContextOverflowError and ordinary 400s will not
  heal by changing venue; fail fast and let the caller see it.

Deliberately NOT a Provider subclass: it has no settings, no base URL,
no client of its own -- it IS a list of those. Duck-typed to the two
methods the agent actually calls. Library-level on purpose: session
persistence stores a provider NAME and rebuilds it via the factory, and
a composite cannot round-trip through a name yet.

All-fail surfacing follows retry.py's honesty rule, upgraded: the LAST
error is the raised exception (its ``__cause__``), and every earlier
attempt's reason rides along in the message -- "primary throttled, then
fallback key invalid" is a diagnosis; either error alone is a riddle.
