"""Retry policy for transient provider failures.

Book-inspired (agent-harness-book ch5), adapted to sync generators:

* RETRY:      429 / 500 / 502 / 503 / 504, plus connection-level failures
              (httpx.TransportError -- DNS, connect, reset, timeout).
* NEVER:      400 / 401 / 403 / 404. A malformed request will not fix
              itself; neither will a wrong key.
* BACKOFF:    exponential with jitter --
                  wait = min(max_delay, base * 2**(attempt-1) + U(0, base))
              Jitter is load-bearing: without it every throttled client
              retries on the same schedule and re-creates the herd that
              caused the throttle.
* Retry-After wins when the provider sends it (429); overriding the
  server's own hint invites harder throttling.

THE STREAMING RULE this module exists to enforce, in two notches:

* OPENING: request -> status line is freely retryable (429/5xx/
  connection errors) -- nothing reached the caller.
* PRE-FIRST-EVENT: a stream that dies AFTER a 200 but BEFORE its first
  event is indistinguishable from a failed opening -- nobody has seen
  anything, so re-opening under the same budgets replays nothing. The
  adapters implement this notch with the same budget arithmetic
  (:func:`budgeted_delay`).
* POST-FIRST-EVENT: never. Replaying would duplicate tokens into
  someone's terminal; failures propagate (durable recovery is a
  checkpointer's job, not a retry loop's).

Budgets are hard ceilings on purpose: attempts AND total wall-clock.
Unbounded retry is how agents run up silent four-figure bills.
