"""The provider interface -- the seam where wire formats are normalized.

Each adapter implements two translations:

* request building:   internal types -> provider JSON
* response parsing:   provider JSON (or SSE events) -> internal types

Everything else in the harness speaks ONLY the internal types from
``yantra.types``. That is what will let the agent switch providers
mid-session: history is stored in internal types, so re-pointing it at a
different adapter requires zero translation of anything.

A provider also OWNS two connection pools (one sync, one async) and is
the thing that gives them back: ``close()`` for the sync pool,
``aclose()`` for both, or either context-manager form. A process that
exits does not need to care. A process that does not exit -- a service
holding many conversations, a test suite building providers in a loop --
does, and before this existed its only option was to reach into
``.client`` and ``.aclient``, which was nobody's promise.
