"""env_context: the agent's own senses -- what it knows without asking.

Out of the box an yantra session starts BLIND: no system prompt, so the
model doesn't know today's date, its timezone, or what city it is sitting
in. Ask it the temperature and it burns a turn asking YOU which city --
not laziness, just honest ignorance with ask_user as the only escape
hatch ([notes/29](../notes/29-environment-awareness.md)). This module
gives sessions graded ambient awareness instead:

* LOCAL facts (mode ``local``): wall-clock time + timezone, user@host,
  OS, working directory. All stdlib reads of the machine itself;
  they leave it only inside requests already being sent.
* LOCATION (mode ``full``, the default): ONE keyless HTTPS lookup to
  ipinfo.io maps the public IP to city/region/country. Cached for the
  whole session -- the network call happens once, at startup (or at the
  first upgrade to ``full``).
* POLICY: whenever awareness is on at any level, the composed prompt
  ends with two sentences telling the model to try its tools before
  asking the human. The facts alone don't change behavior; this line is
  what turns "which city?" into "checking the weather in <your city>".

Design constraints worth remembering:

* THE BLOCK IS FROZEN AT SESSION START. ``--cache`` (anthropic dialect)
  caches the request PREFIX including the system prompt; a per-request
  clock would bust it every turn. Facts are therefore collected once,
  rendered once, and describe themselves as possibly-stale.
* COMPOSITION IS ADDITIVE. The operator's own ``--system`` prompt is
  captured verbatim as the base; awareness appends below it. Nothing
  here edits the operator's words -- and since skills append a roster
  too, the joining lives in yantra.prompt: this module owns exactly
  one named layer (``env``) and never touches the whole string.
* FLIPS ARE LIVE. The loop rebuilds each request from ``agent.system``
  (agent.py passes it per iteration), so /env (REPL) and the env chip
  (web) recompose mid-session and the very next model call sees the new
  mode. No require_idle anywhere -- same argument as permission flips.

Checkpoints store the composed string (session.py saves ``system``
verbatim), which is why attach() captures the base EXACTLY ONCE and
every load path calls reapply() afterwards: a restored session gets a
freshly composed block, not last Tuesday's stale copy compounded under
itself.
