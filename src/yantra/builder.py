"""The build job as a library primitive -- spec in, verified project out.

Claude Code's core loop applied to whole projects: read a spec -> write
files -> RUN the acceptance commands -> read failures -> fix -> repeat.
Promoted here from examples/builder_demo.py because "can it actually
build things" is the question every agent harness must answer for real,
and the answer belongs to the harness core, not a demo script.

THE CONTRACT IS VERIFICATION, NOT TRUST. ``run_build`` never reads the
model's claims about what works:

* acceptance commands are RE-RUN by this module, independently, after
  the turn ends (exit codes + required substrings);
* every ``test_*.py`` present when the build starts is checksummed --
  a repair-style job cannot satisfy "make it green" by weakening the
  tests, because modified tests fail the build outright;
* the exit code doubles as a CI gate: ``BuildResult.ok`` -> 0, else 1.

Workspace layout is the caller's choice (a tempdir for demos,
``.yantra/builds/<ts>/`` for the CLI); fs tools confine themselves to
it via their existing sandbox root, so file writes stay inside no
matter how the model words its paths.
