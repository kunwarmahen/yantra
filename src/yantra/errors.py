"""Exception taxonomy.

Two families, kept deliberately separate:

* Provider/network failures (``ProviderError`` and friends) are terminal
  for the current turn. They propagate out of the agent loop; the CLI
  catches and reports them.
* Tool failures (``ToolError``) NEVER propagate. The agent loop converts
  them into ``is_error`` ToolResults so the model can see what went
  wrong and recover. Errors are data.

Plus one control-flow escape that belongs to neither family:
``UserUnavailable`` (and KeyboardInterrupt before it) derives from
BaseException so no ``except Exception`` anywhere in the loop can
launder it into model-visible data -- see its own docstring.

    errors-are-data conversion exists to protect the MODEL from tool
    failures it could read about and recover from. "Nobody is home" is
    not recoverable -- retrying cannot conjure a user -- so handing the
    model an error result would only invite exactly the guessing this
    signal exists to prevent. Like KeyboardInterrupt (the other
    control-flow escape from a tool), it must survive every broad
    ``except Exception`` between the tool and the UI that reports it.

    result on its way out.
