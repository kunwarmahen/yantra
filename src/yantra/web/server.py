"""The web server: one local browser page driving the SAME agent loop the
REPL drives, with the human interactions (permission prompts, ask_user)
round-tripping over a websocket instead of the terminal.

Architecture in three moves:

* THE LOOP STAYS SYNC. Each turn runs on a worker thread pulling the same
  ``run_streaming`` generator the REPL pulls -- identical semantics for
  gates, batches, cancellation, and resumable history. The server is a
  skin, not a second harness.

* A QUEUE BRIDGE crosses the sync/async boundary. The worker thread is
  blocking by design; the event loop must never. Every human interaction
  is a ``_Pending`` object with its own ``queue.Queue``: the worker blocks
  in ``get(timeout=...)`` polling for an answer AND for cancellation; the
  websocket handler (async side) delivers answers with ``put_nowait``.
  Outbound events fan out to every connected client the same way, via
  ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe`` captured per-connection.

* EVERYTHING IS ENVELOPES. One websocket (/ws) carries tagged JSON both
  ways -- stream deltas, tool cards, permission requests, asks, state --
  so the frontend is a dumb renderer and the session survives reconnects
  (a fresh tab receives ``state``, any still-pending interaction, then a
  transcript replay). REST endpoints cover plain request/response controls.

Cancellation mirrors Ctrl-C exactly: the cancel flag is honored while
streaming (between events), between tool executions, and while blocked on
a human answer -- each path closes the generator so the agent's
resumable-history synthesis runs. Because the loop polls the flag INSIDE
the model stream too (Agent.interrupt_check), a Stop click lands within
one SSE event of a long generation -- the one gap terminal Ctrl-C had
that a signal-less worker thread used to keep open.

Mutating REST endpoints refuse to run mid-turn (409): the REPL serves its
slash commands between turns too -- same single-operator assumption.
