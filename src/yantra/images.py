"""Loading user-supplied images into ImageBlocks.

Providers take base64 payloads inline -- never file paths -- so the CLI
reads and encodes the bytes up front, before any request exists. The
constraints here mirror Anthropic's documented image limits (5 MB per
image; png/jpeg/gif/webp); the OpenAI dialect accepts the same four
types carried as ``data:`` URLs instead.

Validation is deliberately shallow: extension -> MIME mapping and a
size cap. We do NOT sniff magic bytes or decode pixels -- a wrong
extension produces a provider-side 400 the user sees verbatim, which
teaches more than silently second-guessing them.
