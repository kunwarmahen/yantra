"""Shared vocabulary for the whole harness.

These types are the ONLY representation the rest of the program sees.
Provider adapters translate between these objects and each provider's
wire format -- nothing else in the codebase knows what a wire message
looks like. See notes/02-wire-formats.md for the two formats.

Two deliberate simplifications, both inherited from the Anthropic shape:

* There is no ``"system"`` role. The system prompt is per-request
  metadata (Anthropic puts it top-level; OpenAI puts it in
  ``messages[0]``), so it lives outside the conversation history.
* There is no ``"tool"`` role. A tool result is a *block inside a user
  message*, exactly like Anthropic's ``tool_result``. The OpenAI adapter
  fans those blocks out into ``role:"tool"`` wire messages mechanically.
