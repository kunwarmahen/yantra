"""The live skill set: what is on disk, what the prompt says about it,
and what the model may pull.

Three tiers of cost, from the format's design (notes/30):

    tier 1  name + description, in the system prompt, EVERY turn
    tier 2  the body, as a tool result, only when the model asks
    tier 3  bundled files, via read_file, only if the body sends it

This module owns tier 1 and hands out tier 2. Two constraints shape it:

* THE ROSTER IS FROZEN AT SESSION START -- the same rule env_context
  lives under. ``--cache`` caches the request prefix INCLUDING the
  system prompt, so a roster that re-ranked itself per turn would bust
  the cache on every single request. That rules out the obvious trick
  (BM25 the roster against the transcript) and leaves a static list,
  which is the honest shape anyway: the operator wrote these, there are
  rarely more than a dozen, and a name plus one sentence is ~25 tokens.
* ONE TOOL, NOT N. Registering each skill as its own tool would walk
  straight into the tool cliff (selector.py: accuracy falls off between
  30 and 50 tools) and spend a schema per skill on every request.
  ``load_skill`` is one tool whose argument happens to be a name.

A skill declaring ``mode: subagent`` is handed to ``run_skill`` instead,
which spends a fresh child agent to make its ``allowed-tools`` real (see
``delegate`` below). The budget for those children is the sub-agent
budget -- shared with ``spawn_subagent`` when both are on, because both
are the same thing: delegation the operator is paying for.

Past ``ROSTER_LIMIT`` skills the roster degrades to names only and
``list_skills`` registers alongside -- still static, still cache-safe,
with the descriptions moved from every request to one tool result.
