"""The two tools that put skills in the model's hands.

``load_skill`` is the whole feature from the model's side: one tool,
one argument, and the result is a set of instructions to follow. It is
read_only on purpose -- it reads a Markdown file the OPERATOR wrote and
put in their own repo. Gating that behind an approval prompt would
train people to mash 'y' on the one tool that is definitionally safe,
and the instructions it returns still reach the world only through
tools that gate normally (bash, write_file, web_fetch).

``run_skill`` is the delegated twin, registered only when some skill
declares ``mode: subagent``. It is where ``allowed-tools`` stops being a
note and becomes a fence: the body runs in a fresh child agent holding
exactly those tools and nothing else, and only the child's conclusion
comes back. It is NOT read_only -- the child can do whatever its tools
can do, and every one of them still gates individually inside the child.

``list_skills`` exists for the long-roster case only -- past
ROSTER_LIMIT the prompt carries names without descriptions, and this is
where the descriptions went. Below that it is never registered: the
roster already says everything it would.
