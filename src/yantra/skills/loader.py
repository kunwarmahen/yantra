"""Skills on disk: a folder, a SKILL.md, and the rules for reading one.

A SKILL is a chunk of procedural knowledge the operator writes down
once -- how THIS team reviews a PR, how THIS repo cuts a release -- and
the agent loads only when the work calls for it. It is not code and not
a tool: it is instructions, plus whatever files those instructions
reference.

    skills/pr-review/
    |-- SKILL.md          frontmatter + the instructions themselves
    |-- checklist.md      referenced BY the body; read_file fetches it
    `-- scripts/diff.sh   the model runs it with bash

The format, in full:

    ---
    name: pr-review
    description: Review a git diff for correctness bugs and missing
      tests. Use when asked to review a PR, branch, or working tree.
    allowed-tools: bash, read_file, grep
    ---

    # PR review
    ...instructions...

WHY A FOLDER AND NOT A FILE. The description rides in the system prompt
for the whole session (~25 tokens); the body costs nothing until the
model asks for it; bundled files cost nothing until the body sends it
after one. Three tiers of cost, and a folder is what makes the third
tier possible ([notes/30](../notes/30-skills.md)).

WHY A HAND-ROLLED PARSER. The core ships httpx + rich and nothing else
-- the same reason config.py parses .env by hand. Frontmatter here is
deliberately FLAT: ``key: value`` lines, ``#`` comments, indented
continuation lines folded onto the previous key. No nesting, no YAML
types, and the error says so rather than letting a half-parsed block
through.

WHY VALIDATION IS STRICT. A skill with a vague two-word description is
worse than no skill: it burns prompt tokens every turn and still never
gets picked, because selection is retrieval over exactly that text. So
a thin description is an ERROR, reported by name at startup, not a
quiet degradation the operator discovers three sessions later.

TWO MODES. By default a skill is INLINE: its body comes back as a tool
result and the model follows it in the current conversation, with the
current tools. A skill may instead declare ``mode: subagent``, and then
its ``allowed-tools`` stop being a note and become a FENCE -- the body
runs in a fresh child agent that physically has no other tools
registered (see subagent.py). That is the only enforcement the harness
can honestly offer, and it costs a fresh context window to get.

Broken skills never raise into the session. discover() returns them in
a parallel ``broken`` list so ``/skills`` can show the file and the
reason -- one bad folder must not cost you the other nine.
