"""Tool selection as retrieval -- the book's answer to the TOOL CLIFF.

Selection accuracy is roughly flat to ~10 tools, degrades visibly by
20, and falls off a cliff between 30 and 50 -- while every tool's schema
burns 100-500 tokens PER REQUEST. MCP makes 50 easy: three modest
servers and you are past the cliff before the first user message.

The fix (book ch12): treat choosing tools as a RETRIEVAL problem.
Rank all tools against a query derived from the conversation, load only
the top K into the request, and pin the few that must always be there.
BM25 (not embeddings) because queries come from the agent itself and
share vocabulary with tool descriptions; it is ~60 lines, zero
dependencies, and swapping in embeddings later means replacing exactly
one method.

Selection is a context-economy decision about what gets SENT -- never
a second permission system. The loop soft-admits calls that name real
but unselected tools (see Agent._get_visible_tool); only hallucinated
names error.

Three pieces:

* ``ToolCatalog``      -- the index: BM25 over name+description tokens,
                         ``select(query, k, must_include)`` with a score
                         floor (no-match tools are EXCLUDED, not ranked last).
* ``query_from_transcript`` -- first user message as anchor + recent
                         assistant text and tool-call names. Tool names
                         carry vocabulary: "mcp__slack__post_message"
                         appearing in history is itself a query term.
* ``ListAvailableTools``    -- the pinned discovery hatch for the two
                         holes retrieval cannot close: vague openers
                         where everything scores zero, and mid-task pivots
                         whose new vocabulary hasn't reached the transcript.

Rule of thumb (book's numbers, kept as constants here): below
AUTO_THRESHOLD tools don't bother; above it this keeps the model sharp.

#: The autonomy loop's floor -- every task reads and writes files and

#: query when the TASK is about files ("edit config.yaml"). "Fix this
#: bug in parser.py" matches none of them, so retrieval would drop
#: write_file exactly when the turn needs it next. Pins beat the query:
#: they load every turn regardless of score (book ch12: "pin the few
#: that must always be there"). The LONG TAIL -- MCP tools, browser,
#: background jobs -- stays retrievable; that is what selection is for.
#: ``load_skill`` joins them for the same reason from the other side: the
#: roster in the system prompt PROMISES the model it can load any skill
#: named there, and a promise BM25 can drop is a promise broken on
#: exactly the vague opening turns skills are written for. (Pins absent
#: from the registry are skipped, so this costs nothing when a project
#: has no skills -- see enable_selection.)

#: Arithmetic: len(CORE_PINS) pins + the discovery hatch leaves four or
#: five slots for retrieved long-tail tools (load_skill only occupies one
#: in a project that has skills) -- k below the pin count would leave
#: BM25 nothing to do.
