"""Background bash -- start long commands now, read their output later.

Synchronous bash caps every command at ten minutes and blocks the whole
batch while it runs, which fits "run pytest" and rules out everything
that is a PHASE rather than a step: the dev server the model wants to
curl afterwards, the watch-mode build, the data pipeline it can work
around meanwhile. Three small verbs fill the gap:

* ``bash_start(command)`` -> job id, output teeing to
  ``.yantra/jobs/<id>.log`` from birth (nothing buffered in memory --
  a three-hour job never grows a three-hour string).
* ``bash_poll([job_id])   -> one job's status + recent output, or an
  index of every job when called without one. Doubles as the reaper:
  poll() is what notices a process exited.
* ``bash_kill(job_id)     -> SIGKILL the whole process group.

Deliberate honesty about trust: background jobs do NOT go through the
ToolSandbox protocol. The sandbox's execute() is synchronous by shape,
and wrapping bubblewrap around a job that must OUTLIVE this call would
tie its lifetime to ours anyway. So jobs are plain env-scrubbed
subprocesses and every one of them gates like unsandboxed bash does --
trust_sandbox's auto-approval covers the synchronous tool only.

Lifecycle is equally honest: jobs belong to the HARNESS PROCESS. A
started server keeps running after the session ends (usually what you
want); after a restart, old ids are gone though their logs stay on
disk where read_file can still reach them.
