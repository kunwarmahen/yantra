"""read_image -- the agent looking at a picture BY ITSELF.

The /image flag lets the HUMAN attach a picture to a prompt; this tool
completes the other half of the vision loop: the model deciding it
needs eyes. "What's in screenshot.png?", "does the chart I just
generated look right?", "read the diagram in docs/architecture.png" --
before this existed those all bounced off read_file's binary refusal,
which is honest but useless.

Mechanically it is thin ON PURPOSE: load_image_block (yantra.images)
already owns validation -- extension allowlist, 5 MB cap -- and both
provider dialects already carry ImageBlocks in user messages. The only
new machinery is the hand-off, and THAT is where the design lives:

``run()`` returns a ToolOutput (text + images). The loop splits it --
text becomes the ordinary ToolResult string; images are hoisted onto
history right after the results, because the OpenAI-family wires have
no way to put an image inside a role:"tool" payload at all. Anthropic
COULD nest one inside tool_result content, but one path through history
keeps the two dialects' transcripts identical -- which is exactly what
the adapter-parity tests pin.
