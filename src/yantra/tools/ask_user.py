"""ask_user: the tool that pauses a turn to talk to its human.

Every other tool answers a question the MODEL has about the world;
this one lets the model ask one of the USER. Ambiguity is normal in
real tasks ("which config file did you mean?", "Postgres or SQLite?",
"may I delete it?") and a harness that can't route that question to
the person who knows the answer forces the model to guess.

Three pieces:

* ``UserChannel``      -- WHERE the human is. A tiny protocol: ``ask()``
  blocks until an answer exists. The REPL supplies stdin; the web UI
  supplies a websocket round-trip; tests supply a canned lambda.
* ``AskUser(Tool)``    -- what the MODEL sees. Validates args, calls the
  channel, formats the answer as the tool-result string. ``read_only``
  because asking costs nothing: it never gates.
* ``UserUnavailable``  -- what happens when NOBODY is home (headless
  one-shot, piped stdin, evals, build agents). The tool raises instead
  of returning data -- deliberately ``BaseException``, so no
  ``except Exception`` in the loop converts "no user" into a result the
  model would try to explain away with a guess (see errors.py).

The blocking is honest, not a hack: tools run on worker threads, and
"waiting for a human" is IO like any other -- bounded by the human's
patience rather than a timeout, which is exactly right for a question
that was important enough to stop work over.

Sub-agents inherit the channel by reference when their catalog includes
this tool instance -- a child pausing to consult the same human through
the same UI is coherent, and needs no extra wiring.
