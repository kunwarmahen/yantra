"""Tool abstractions: what a tool IS, and where tools live.

A tool is three things glued together:

* ``parameters``   -- hand-written JSON Schema. Writing schemas by hand
  (with real ``description`` strings, ``required`` lists, and
  ``additionalProperties: false``) is part of the lesson: vague schemas
  produce vague tool calls.
* ``summary(args)`` -- what the PERMISSION PROMPT shows a human before a
  dangerous call runs ("bash: rm -rf ..."). Built by the tool because the
  tool knows its own shape (diffs for writes, the literal command for bash).
* ``run(args, ctx)`` -- do the thing, return a string. Raise ToolError
  for anything the MODEL could plausibly fix; the agent loop converts
  that into an error result and keeps going.

# Argument coercion: repairing the stringified-JSON habit

# non-scalar argument as a STRING of JSON:
#
#     {"symbols": "[\"AAPL\"]"}      instead of      {"symbols": ["AAPL"]}
#
# Nothing in the harness is mis-parsing when that happens. The wire
# carried a string, ``json.loads`` faithfully produced a string, and the
# tool (or an MCP server's JSON-Schema validator) correctly rejects it:
#
#     validating /properties/symbols: type: ["AAPL"] has type "string",
#     want one of "null, array"
#
# The schema is right there, though, and it says what was meant. So we
# repair it rather than make every array-taking tool unusable on models
# with this habit -- which is most of them at small sizes, and this
# project treats local models as a first-class road.
#
# The one rule that keeps this honest: NEVER coerce a parameter whose
# schema also accepts a string. There, a string is a legitimate value and
# "looks like JSON" is not permission to reinterpret it -- a grep pattern
# of "[0-9]" must stay the text the caller typed.
