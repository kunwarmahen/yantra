"""Exclusive, expiring holds on shared resources -- the ch17 hazard list,
kept as small as it promised.

Parallel tool batches made a race REAL: two ``edit_file`` calls aimed at
one path in the same batch can interleave read-modify-write and silently
eat an edit. The book's answer is leases; the principle we kept from its
guidance is *reads need no leases* -- only mutating tools ever hold one.

Semantics, each chosen for a reason:

* **TTL on every lease** -- a crashed/hung holder must not deadlock the
  resource forever. Expiry is checked at ACQUIRE time (lazy, no reaper
  thread): the next contender steals naturally.
* **Blocking acquire with deadline** -- most conflicts are siblings from
  one batch finishing in milliseconds; waiting converts them into
  serialization for free. Only past the deadline does it surface as
  ``LeaseBusy`` -- a ToolError, so errors-are-data applies: the model
  reads who held what and can retry.
* **Reentrancy by owner** -- the same owner re-acquiring refreshes the
  TTL instead of deadlocking against itself; nested holds count depth
  and the LAST release frees.
* **Only the holder releases** -- releasing someone else's lease is a
  bug, not a no-op.

Honest scope: guards ONE process's shared contexts (a tool batch's
workers all share the agent's ToolContext). Sub-agents build their own
ToolContext and their own manager -- their runs are already serialized
against the parent's batch, so there is nothing here for them to share
YET. And bash bypasses both the sandbox and this: consistency, since
bash was never confinable.
