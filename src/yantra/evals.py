"""Evals: trajectory-level checks that the harness produces RIGHT BEHAVIOR.

Unit tests pin mechanics with scripted providers (deterministic, free,
every commit). Evals ask a different question -- did a REAL model, over
a whole trajectory, finish the task, use the right tools, stay in
budget? -- so they cost money, are probabilistic, and belong on a
merge/nightly cadence, not per-commit. "Agent complexity is only
justified when you can define precise task-success criteria" (Hamel
Husain, via book ch19); without evals, agent features are debt.

Four metric classes, all checked per case and ACCUMULATED (a case can
fail for five reasons at once -- seeing all five is how you fix it):

* completion   -- it finished (crashes and iteration caps become
                 failed results, never raised exceptions)
* correctness  -- task-specific, deterministic where possible
                 (``check_answer``); reserve LLM judging (``judge``)
                 for genuinely subjective criteria
* process      -- required tools used, forbidden tools avoided
* cost         -- token and iteration ceilings; a correct answer at
                 50K tokens is worse than the same answer at 5K

The recording trick: the runner wraps every tool in a proxy that
appends each ACTUAL execution to a shared list before delegating, so
process checks see what really ran -- including work a sub-agent did
through the same tool instances (documented conflation: delegation is
the parent's doing).

Every real failure in production should leave a fossil in the suite:
``case_from_trace`` turns an observed failure into a regression case
whose budget is observed-cost x 1.5.
