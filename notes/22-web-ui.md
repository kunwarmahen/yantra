# 22 — The web UI: a second skin over the same loop

*`--web` turns the terminal harness into a local browser app — without
forking the agent loop. Every hard problem (gates, cancellation,
resumable history) was already solved once; the web layer only builds a
new front door to the same rooms.*

## The one rule: the loop stays sync

The agent loop is a blocking generator ([notes/05](notes/05-agent-loop.md)).
The tempting rewrite is to port it to asyncio so it "fits" the server.
That would be a second harness to maintain, with subtle differences from
the terminal one. So instead: **each turn runs on an ordinary worker
thread** pulling the very same `run_streaming()` generator the REPL
pulls. Gates, parallel batches, Ctrl-C semantics, the history invariant —
all inherited free, because nothing about them changed.

What remains is crossing the border between that worker thread and the
server's event loop, and it is crossed with boring parts only:

* **Inbound** (human → agent): each open question owns a
  `queue.Queue`. The worker blocks in `get(timeout=0.2)` — polling
  rather than blocking forever, because the timeout tick is also where
  it notices the cancel flag. The async side drops answers in with
  `put_nowait`; it never waits on the worker.
* **Outbound** (agent → browsers): events fan out to every connected
  tab via `loop.call_soon_threadsafe`, captured per connection. A dead
  tab's failing dispatch is swallowed; `disconnect()` reaps it.

No locks around the agent (one turn at a time, enforced with a 409 on
concurrent requests), no shared mutable state across threads beyond the
client list (guarded) and the pending-question slot (single operator).

## One bridge, two questions

The permission prompt and `ask_user` turned out to be the *same
mechanism*: broadcast a question, block for an id-tagged answer, clean
up. A `_Pending` object carries whichever kind it is; the browser
answers `{type: "answer", id, ...}` and doesn't need to know which.
Cancellation pushes a sentinel into the same queue and the waiter
raises `KeyboardInterrupt` — literally the Ctrl-C exception, so the
turn unwinds through the exact code path the terminal uses.

Two details worth stealing from the terminal gate, because parity is
the product:

* **Read-only never prompts.** First line of the web gate:
  `if request.read_only: return True`. Without it, every `read_file`
  and every `ask_user` pops a needless approval modal — this bit me
  immediately once the tests wired the real gate in.
* **Edit round-trips.** Choosing *edit* sends new args; the server
  swaps them into `request.arguments`, re-renders the preview through
  the tool's own `summarize` (the seam from [notes/20](notes/20-approve-with-edits.md)),
  and re-asks tagged `edited: true`. What you approve in the browser is
  what runs, and history keeps the edited form.

`WebSession` also *is* the `UserChannel`: its `.channel` property
returns itself, since it already implements `ask()` over the same
bridge. One plumbing system serves both interactive surfaces — the same
trick as handing `SpawnSubagent` its spawner object.

## Everything is envelopes

One websocket (`/ws`) carries tagged JSON both ways; the page is a dumb
renderer over it.

| Server → browser | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `state` | provider/model/tools/usage/utilization/env-awareness snapshot |
| `start` · `delta` · `thinking_delta` | a response is streaming |
| `tool_start` · `tool_result` | card opened / filled (args, output, error?) |
| `permission_request` | approve / deny / edit, with the tool's own summary |
| `ask` | ask_user question + labeled choices + context |
| `resolved` | the question with this id left the screen (any outcome) |
| `turn_end` · `turn_cancelled` · `turn_error` | how the turn ended, honestly |
| `turn_started` · `turn_done` | bracket every turn |

Browser → server is tiny: `answer {id, decision \| text}` and `cancel`.

Because the transcript is rebuilt from `history_envelopes()` on every
connect, a refresh or a second tab rejoins mid-conversation: state and
any still-pending question over the socket, then a replay fetched from
`/api/history` and rendered in the same shapes as the live feed. The
replay comes by that one road only — sent down the socket as well, every
earlier turn was drawn twice. Plain request/response controls stay REST
(`/api/message`, `/api/model`, `/api/provider`, `/api/permissions`,
`/api/env-context`, `/api/tools`, `/api/save`, `/api/load`,
`/api/compact`, `/api/clear`),
and mutating ones refuse to run mid-turn (409) — the REPL serves slash
commands between turns too; same single-operator assumption. Two
deliberate exceptions skip that guard:

* `/api/permissions` — flipping ask ⇄ yolo mid-turn is safe (the loop
  consults the gate per call) and is exactly how you rescue a turn
  stuck in approval modals.
* `/api/tools` — `GET` lists every registered tool with its read-only
  flag and on/off state; `POST {"name": ..., "enabled": ...}` flips
  one. Safe for the same reason: the registry's disabled set is
  consulted LIVE at every layer ([17-tool-selection.md](17-tool-selection.md)),
  so pulling a tool mid-turn just makes its *next* call fail as data
  ("disabled by the operator"), which the model reads and routes
  around.
* `/api/mcp/toggle` — the same soft switch pointed at a whole MCP
  server's toolset (`MCPManager.set_enabled`, process stays warm);
  skips the idle guard for exactly the same live-consulted reason.
* `/api/env-context` — flips session awareness (off ⇄ local ⇄ full);
  the composed system prompt is consulted per request, so a flip lands
  on the running turn's next model call
  ([29-environment-awareness.md](29-environment-awareness.md)).

The rest of the MCP family DOES take the guard, deliberately:
`POST /api/mcp/add` spawns child processes and registers tools (and
`/api/mcp/remove` closes them) — mutating the registry mid-batch would
race iteration, so those two are 409 while a turn runs, like every
other mutator. `add` accepts either form fields (`name` +
`command`+`args`+`env`, or `url` for Streamable HTTP) or a pasted JSON
blob in the same shape as `--mcp-config`
(`{"servers": {...}}`) parsed server-side; each entry reports its own
result inside `results[]` — one bad server is an `ok:false` row, not a
500 hiding the three that worked. A checked-by-default "remember"
saves the entry to `.yantra/mcp.json` for auto-reconnect on future
launches; remove always forgets it. A click-by-click walkthrough of
that panel -- adding a server both ways, watching a local model call
it, and the three traps (cwd-relative paths, remember-by-default, the
stdio radio) -- lives in
[09-mcp.md](09-mcp.md#trying-it-in-the-portal-end-to-end).

All of these broadcast a fresh `state` so other open tabs follow
along. The top-bar mode chip shows the permission mode — red while
yolo — and clicking it flips; the env chip beside it shows the session-
awareness level and cycles off ⇄ local ⇄ full on click (its tooltip
carries the exact fact sheet the model sees,
[29-environment-awareness.md](29-environment-awareness.md)); the
servers & tools chip opens a panel holding both halves: the MCP rows first (health dot, transport
badge, `saved` tag, per-server switch, a two-step remove button whose
first click arms "sure?" instead of trusting a native dialog), then
the tool switches with a count of how many are off. Same objects back
the REPL's `/yolo`, `/env`, `/tools off|on`, and `/mcp` commands
([06-cli.md](06-cli.md)). Sessions without an MCP manager (the
library path) simply hide the servers half.

The `state` snapshot also carries the context-pressure numbers
(`context_tokens`, `context_window`, an `estimated` flag for when only
the chars/4 fallback is available), and every `tool_result` envelope
carries fresh utilization — so the meter in the header updates during
a turn, not just between turns. The bar turns amber at 60% and red at
80%, mirroring exactly where auto-compaction starts caring
([07-reliability-and-scale.md](07-reliability-and-scale.md)); hovering
shows the raw numbers.

A second bar sits beside it when the turn has a dollar ceiling, using
the same widget and the same thresholds
([43-a-bar-and-a-deadline.md](43-a-bar-and-a-deadline.md)). That was the
point of putting it there rather than inventing a separate readout: both
answer "how much of something finite has this turn used", so one
instrument with two strips reads better than two widgets that happen to
be adjacent. It shows what is LEFT rather than what is spent, and a
ceiling that can never fire — a local model, which bills nothing — draws
an empty bar labelled `free` instead of a full one that would look like
protection.

## Rendering the model's prose

Models answer in markdown — headers, tables, fenced code — and a
transcript that shows those literally is failing at its one job. The
fix is `static/md.js`, ~150 lines of hand-rolled renderer with no
library and no build step (the page can't fetch a CDN anyway; the CSP
forbids it, same rule that keeps the core deps at httpx + rich).

The security model is stated once in its header and enforced
everywhere: model text is HTML-escaped FIRST, then wrapped in tags we
generate ourselves. `<script>` arrives as visible text; link URLs must
look like `http(s)`/`mailto` or they degrade to plain text. The parser
covers what models actually emit — headings mapped two levels down (a
chat message isn't a document outline), nested lists by indentation,
pipe tables, fenced code, blockquotes — and deliberately not images.

Streaming shapes the integration more than parsing does: deltas
re-render the whole message but throttled to one pass per animation
frame, and a partial document (half a table, an open fence) simply
renders as far as it got; `turn_end` carries the complete text and its
final render settles any artifact. Ten offline tests execute md.js
under node (`test_md_renderer.py`, skipped when node is absent) — the
escaping rules are pinned hardest, because they're the part that must
never regress.

A war story from the REST side: `SessionStore` was built on the main
thread, but FastAPI handlers execute on the event-loop thread — and
SQLite connections are thread-affine by default, so every `/api/save`
500'd until the store learned `check_same_thread=False` plus one lock
around writes. The REPL never hit this because it is single-threaded;
the web skin's first gift to the core was finding that latent bug.

## When nobody is home

`ask_user` needs a human; headless runs have none. The channel is
registered as `None` whenever stdin/stdout aren't a TTY (piped runs,
cron, evals), and a call raises `UserUnavailable` — deliberately a
`BaseException`, so the loop's errors-are-data conversion cannot turn
"no user" into a tool result the model would explain away with a guess
([tools/ask_user.py](../src/yantra/tools/ask_user.py),
[errors.py](../src/yantra/errors.py)). The turn fails loudly, exit
code 1, history stays resumable. Receipt below.

## Cancel is Ctrl-C, at every checkpoint including mid-sentence

The Cancel button sets a flag honored everywhere the terminal honors
SIGINT — between yielded loop events (the generator is closed,
outstanding calls synthesized, history stays valid), while blocked on a
human question, and now **during the model call itself**: the session
hands the agent an `interrupt_check` callback (it reads the cancel
flag), and the loop polls it between stream events inside `_tee`.
Worker threads get no signals, so this is cooperation, not preemption —
but a healthy connection yields deltas constantly, so the stop lands
milliseconds after the click instead of at turn's end. The honest edge:
a provider gone silent sends nothing to poll between, so the worst case
is still "next checkpoint". Either way the unwind is the same code path
Ctrl-C takes, history resumable ([05-agent-loop.md](05-agent-loop.md)).
In the page, Esc does the same as the ■ button whenever a turn is
running and no modal owns the keyboard.

## Starting and stopping without giving up your terminal

`--web` in the foreground owns the tab it runs in, which is fine until
you want the UI *and* your shell. `./start.sh web-start` (the launcher
from [notes/06](06-cli.md)) detaches it: `nohup` + background, with
three small files in `.yantra/` as the whole state machine —
`web-ui.pid`, `web-ui.port`, `web-ui.log`.

The parts that earned their keep:

* **Health check before bind.** Startup polls `GET /` until the UI
  answers (uv boot takes a few seconds) and only then prints the URL —
  and if the port answers *before* launching, it refuses. A fresh
  server would just die on bind; saying "something is already serving
  on port 8321" beats a mysterious traceback in a log nobody tails.
* **Status tells the truth about ownership.** `web-status` only claims
  what the pid file proves. Port answering but no pid file? That's an
  instance someone started by hand, and it says exactly that instead of
  a bare "stopped" that would leave you hunting a process this script
  can't stop.
* **Stop takes the children.** `uv run` wraps python, so killing the
  recorded pid can strand the server as an orphan: kill the children
  first (`pkill -P`), then the pid, wait up to 5s, then SIGKILL. The
  port-closed check after stop is the real test, not the exit code.

## In a container

The UI also runs boxed (`Containerfile` in the repo root): code only in
the image, keys mounted or env-passed at run time. Two lessons from the
first build:

* **An unreadable `.env` used to crash startup.** A rootless bind mount
  of a 600-perm file is invisible to the container's user, and
  `_load_dotenv` took that personally. Now an `OSError` on read means
  "treat as absent" — real env vars still work, which is exactly the
  loader's own stated philosophy.
* **Env vars don't tip the provider guess.** `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` set but
  no cloud key anywhere → `_guess_provider` still errors, because it
  only recognizes keys. Container runs must pass
  `--provider ollama` explicitly; the image therefore uses an
  ENTRYPOINT so run-time flags compose instead of replacing the default.
* The reward: with `host.containers.internal` the container reached the
  host's Ollama unprompted, and a POST to `/api/message` came back with
  the exact reply requested — agent loop, toolset and all, fully inside
  the box. Tools see only `/app`, so the container *is* the sandbox.

Daily use is one command, `./start.sh container start` (menu item 6):
build if the image is missing, run detached, and wait for `/` to
answer. Your other server's port is sacred — the container defaults to
8321 and only *moves up* (8322–8342) when that is already serving
something, so launching it can never kill a web UI you left running.
`stop`, `status`, `restart`, `logs` are the companions — and the script
only ever touches a container it started itself (`yantra-web`). A `yes`
menu answer adds `--auto-approve` (`YANTRA_AUTO_APPROVE`); `--model`,
`--timeout`, `--max-turns` pass through to the CLI. An explicit
`--port` already busy is refused — it tells you the port, it doesn't
take it.

## The skills section

The tools panel grew a third section (servers → skills → tools), fed by
three endpoints that mirror the REPL's commands exactly: `GET
/api/skills` for the set, `GET /api/skills/{name}` for one body, `POST
/api/skills/reload` to re-scan.

Two decisions worth recording:

**Reload and the skill toggle take `require_idle()`; the tool toggles
deliberately do not.**
Switching a tool off mid-turn is the *point* — the loop re-consults the
registry per call, so a runaway chain can be cut without waiting it out.
The skills roster is different: it is a system-prompt layer, and
rewriting the prompt under a running turn changes the request in flight.
So the ones that edit the prompt wait, and the one that edits the
registry does not. `POST /api/skills` is otherwise the exact shape of
`POST /api/tools` — name + enabled, 404 on an unknown name, a broadcast
so every open tab's panel follows along.

**Reading a skill in the panel does not mark it loaded.** Each row shows
a filled dot when the model actually pulled that skill this session —
the first question every skill author asks is "did it even fire?", and a
dot that also lit up when a *human* clicked to read the file would be
answering a different question. So `GET /api/skills/{name}` reads
straight off the registry's discovered copy and never touches the load
record; only `load_skill` does.

## Writing a skill from the browser

`PUT /api/skills/{name}` creates or updates one, and the panel has the
form: name, description, instructions, inline-or-delegated, and the
delegated extras when you pick that mode.

The thing that makes this safe to expose is that it is not a file-write
endpoint with a skill-shaped name. Three rules:

- **The name is re-validated against the loader's grammar** (lowercase,
  digits, hyphens). A path segment is all a name can ever be, so
  `../../etc/passwd` dies at the regex rather than at some later path
  check that someone will eventually get wrong.
- **The text is validated by being parsed back.** `render_skill_md`
  composes the file, `validate_text` runs every rule a hand-written
  SKILL.md faces, and only then does anything touch disk — so the editor
  cannot persist a skill that would show up broken in `/skills`. The 422
  carries the loader's own message, which is the useful one ("description
  is too thin (11 chars): say what the skill does AND when to use it").
- **An edit rewrites in place, wherever the skill lives.** Writing an
  edit of a `~/.yantra/skills` skill into the project root would create
  a shadowing copy and leave the original behind — two files, one name,
  and a user wondering why their change did nothing.

The write is atomic (temp + `os.replace`), like the note store: a crash
mid-save leaves the previous version, never half a file.

One asymmetry worth stating: `GET /api/skills/{name}` returns `mode`,
`output_format` and `max_iterations` even though the *panel list* does
not need them. The editor PUTs back exactly what the GET handed it, so a
field missing from the read is a field silently erased on the next save.

There is deliberately no delete. Removing a file from a web UI is a
sharper edge than adding one, and the soft answer already exists: switch
the skill off and it is gone from the model's world without anything
leaving your disk.

A session started with `--no-skills` answers 400 on all of them, and the
panel hides the section — the same shape the MCP section already uses
when no manager is wired.

## The surface itself: one design system

The panel, the transcript and the composer are not styled one at a
time. `static/style.css` opens with a token block — surfaces, hairlines,
three ink levels, one accent, three semantic colours, four elevations, a
six-step radius ladder, two easings — and every rule after it spends
those tokens and nothing else. Dark mode is the same system with swapped
values, written twice on purpose: once under `prefers-color-scheme` for
the OS default, once under `:root[data-theme="dark"]` for an explicit
pick, so neither depends on the other resolving first. The appearance
button in the header cycles system ⇄ light ⇄ dark and remembers the
choice in `localStorage`; a tiny inline script in `<head>` applies it
before first paint, so a reload never flashes the wrong surface.

Three decisions carried most of the weight:

* **The browser's `prompt()` and `confirm()` are gone.** Switching a
  model, naming a checkpoint and clearing history all used native
  dialogs — the one place the app fell out of its own skin, and on some
  platforms a modal that blocks the whole tab. They are now in-page
  dialogs on their own overlay layer (z-index 45), between the tools
  panel (40) and the approval modal (50), so an approval can still land
  on top of one mid-run. Escape closes them in the capture phase and
  stops there, deliberately: it must not also reach the document
  handler that cancels a running turn. Cancel now means cancel, too —
  dismissing the save prompt used to fall through to saving `default`.
* **The provider chip is a menu, not a text box.** The roster is fixed
  (`anthropic | openai | responses | ollama`), and a fixed roster reads
  better as four rows with a tick beside the live one than as a box you
  have to spell correctly.
* **Icons come from one sprite.** A `<defs>` block at the top of
  `index.html` holds every glyph; each use is a `<use href="#i-…">` on a
  24-grid with `currentColor`, so an icon inherits whatever state its
  button is in. No emoji in the chrome, and no icon font to ship.

Everything states itself the same way it did before — a disabled tool
still strikes through its own name, yolo still turns its chip red,
health dots still mean health. What changed is that the transcript now
has an empty state instead of a blank page, forms scroll themselves into
view when they open, focus is visible on every control, and the whole
thing reflows to one column on a phone, where the panel and the modals
become bottom sheets. `prefers-reduced-motion` switches every animation
off.

## What the tests pin

52 new offline tests, no network, no key:

* `test_ask_user.py` (17): free-text and choice answers reach history
  with the `(picked option k/N)` marker; five arg-validation ToolErrors;
  no-channel fails the turn AND the session survives to a clean next
  turn; a batch-mate running beside a failed ask keeps its real result;
  `read_only=True` never gates; TerminalChannel choice/free-text/
  empty-reprompt/EOF behaviors.
* `test_web_server.py` (33): connect handshake (state, pending question,
  replay); streaming deltas; deny becomes error data; the full
  edit→re-summary→approve round-trip adopting edited args into history;
  ask answered over the wire; cancel during a pending ask, then the
  session serves another turn; 409 on concurrency; 400 validations;
  save/load with injectable provider factories; the strict restore path
  whose provider has no key fails cleanly and leaves the live agent
  untouched — plus the newer pins: tools listing with detail, toggle
  validation errors, a disabled tool's call failing as data MID-turn
  (an `ask_user` parks the worker so the flip lands deterministically),
  state broadcasts reaching a second open tab, `interrupt_check` wired
  to the cancel flag, pressure numbers in `state`, and the MCP family:
  list/add/remove round trip over a fake connector, whole-server toggle
  allowed mid-turn while add/remove 409, connection failure arriving as
  an `ok:false` row rather than a 500, mixed good+bad JSON-mode results,
  field-shape validations, and the remember flag persisting only what
  was kept.
* `test_md_renderer.py` (10): the page's markdown renderer executed by
  node — escaping above all (model HTML stays text), emphasis/code/
  strike, heading mapping, fenced code, tables, nested and ordered
  lists, scheme-checked links, `<br>` paragraphs, blockquotes/rules.

## Live receipt

All against local Ollama `qwen3.8` (27B, Q4):

1. **Headless fail**: `uv run yantra --provider ollama --model qwen3.8
   "Write a poem about my favorite editor..."` — the model searched its
   notes first (`recall_notes` came up empty), then called `ask_user`,
   and the run ended: `turn failed: ask_user ran with no interactive
   user attached (headless run). Failing the turn rather than guessing.`,
   exit 1, no hang.
2. **REPL ask**: asked it to learn my favorite language before writing.
   It offered numbered choices (`[1-5, or your own answer]>`), I typed
   `2`, the tool result read `user replied: (picked option 2/5) Rust`,
   the gated `write_file` panel followed, `y` approved, and the haiku
   landed in `lang.txt` — end_turn after 3 iterations.
3. **Browser drive**: served `--web`, drove the real websocket. The
   `ask` envelope arrived with five editor choices; answering "Kakoune"
   produced `(picked option 1/5) Kakoune` in the tool card; the
   `write_file` approval showed a genuine diff preview (the file
   existed); approve wrote the sentence; the footer read
   `$0.00 (local model)`. Sending `cancel` while the modal was open gave
   `resolved` → `turn_cancelled`, and the next message ran clean.
4. **Honest miss → fixed**: the first time around, firing cancel right
   after the first text delta did NOT stop a 300-word essay — the
   in-flight model call ran on to completion, exactly as this note then
   documented as a limit. That miss is what bought the cooperative
   interrupt above: re-running the same experiment now stops within a
   delta or two of the click, with the partial reply left on screen and
   history clean for the next message.
