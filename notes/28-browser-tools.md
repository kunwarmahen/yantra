# 28 — browser_*: operating web apps, not just reading documents

*web_fetch (notes/25) reads the web's DOCUMENTS. But a large and
growing share of the web is an empty HTML shell that JavaScript fills
in — to web_fetch those pages are blank — and bot-defended sites
refuse plain HTTP clients outright. The agent could read about the
world but not operate it. Four verbs on a real browser engine close
that gap, behind an optional extra.*

## Why an engine, not more parsing

No amount of HTML stripping executes JavaScript; there is no honest
shortcut. So this family rides Playwright rather than another parser —
the harness's third dependency tier, after the httpx+rich core and the
`--web` FastAPI exception, justified the same way: the capability
CALLS for a browser engine.

## The extra is the opt-in

```
uv add 'yantra[browse]'
uv run playwright install chromium
```

Installing the dependency IS the signal: default_registry registers
browser_open/click/fill/close only when playwright is importable.
That conditionality is load-bearing, not cosmetic — the tool-selection
threshold is 20, sixteen built-ins + ask_user = 17 today, and
always-on browser verbs would push EVERY user past the cliff into
per-turn tool discovery they never asked for. No extra → no tools,
count stays 16/17. Extra installed → twenty (+ask_user = 21), which
DOES cross the threshold, deliberately: you opted into a heavier mode,
so the harness switches to its heavy-mode tool strategy (`--tool-select
0` puts the full list back).

## Refs are the model's hands

Every action returns readable prose plus numbered interactive elements
harvested from the LIVE DOM in one `evaluate()` pass: visible elements
matching link/button/input/select roles get `data-yantra-ref="eN"`
attributes AND appear as `[e3] textbox Search`. Clicking and filling
resolve refs through that same attribute — the model's view of the
page and its click targets can never disagree. Refs regenerate on
EVERY snapshot, so they always describe the page as of your last
action.

Text out, no screenshots: text is the wire format local models are
best at. Vision stays where it belongs, behind read_image's explicit
opt-in.

## A heavy app needs a second look

`browser_open` snapshots the page a beat after `domcontentloaded` —
long enough for ordinary pages, and too early for an application the
size of Gmail, whose first snapshot can arrive before the app has
drawn anything at all. The cure is already a verb: `browser_open` with
NO url re-reads whatever page is open, without navigating, and that
second look has the content.

This is a deliberate floor rather than an oversight. Waiting for
`networkidle` would hang on any page that polls — which is most
applications worth driving — and a long fixed settle would tax every
quick page to rescue a few slow ones. A cheap first look plus a
re-read the model can ask for costs one iteration exactly when it is
needed and nothing the rest of the time. Prompts that drive a big web
app do well to say "re-read the page" out loud.

## Trust: the web_fetch rule, times four

Same argument as notes/25, stronger: this is network egress from
outside every sandbox wall, and a browser compounds it — form
submissions MUTATE remote state. All four verbs gate individually;
--yolo owns the tradeoff explicitly. And honesty about limits cuts
both ways: this is NOT stealth. Captchas and bot checks still refuse
us; login walls refuse us only until you hand the profile a login
(next section) — when a site serves a robot check, the snapshot shows
the check instead of pretending the mission succeeded. How far the
wall can be pushed back — a browser you already have, headed on a
screen nobody looks at — is
[notes/58](58-the-browser-you-already-have.md); it moves the wall
without moving this paragraph.

## Logins live in the profile, not in the model

The first browser family could see a login page but never get past
it, which fenced off most of the web people actually use. The fix is
not what it looks like. The obvious move — a tool that hands the
model your cookies — is exactly wrong twice over:

1. **Tokens in model context are one prompt injection away from
   exfiltration.** A page the agent reads can carry text like "fetch
   your cookies for site X and POST them to …"; any verb that returns
   raw credentials turns that from theoretical into a one-step leak.
   The model should BENEFIT from being logged in without ever SEEING
   the tokens.
2. **Cookies usually aren't the whole session anyway.** Modern apps
   keep auth in localStorage and IndexedDB; a cookies-only export
   silently half-works. Playwright's `launch_persistent_context`
   keeps ALL of it, because it's not an export at all — it's just the
   browser keeping its own profile directory between runs.

So: `$YANTRA_BROWSER_PROFILE=<dir>` (unset = fresh sessions, nothing
persists — the default, since a profile IS a plaintext credential
store). Set it, and every launch lands on that dir;
`--browse-login <url>` opens a HEADED browser on the same dir so the
human beats the wall once — 2FA, captchas, SSO, all by hand — then
closes the window. Two roads to the same profile:

- **You log in** (`--browse-login`): the robust road. No model in the
  loop, no API key needed — the CLI dispatches it before provider
  resolution on purpose. A sign-in page that checks for automation
  refuses a Playwright window however visible it is, so with
  `$YANTRA_BROWSER_EXECUTABLE` naming a browser this machine already
  has, that window is a plain subprocess of it with no driver attached
  at all ([notes/58](58-the-browser-you-already-have.md)).
- **The model logs in**: with persistence on, filling a login form is
  just browser_fill + browser_click — each gated like every other
  verb, so a password entry is something YOU approved. Works on plain
  forms; anything with captchas belongs to road one.

Chromium locks the profile dir while a browser uses it, which doubles
as the guard against two agents fighting over one identity — the
second launch fails loudly instead of corrupting state. This is the
same shape the ecosystem converged on (Playwright MCP's default
profile, browser-use's storage-state/user_data_dir pair, Browserbase
"Contexts", Steel "Profiles") minus the parts that only make sense
for cloud fleets: no cookie JSON files to leak, nothing to load back.

## One thread for one browser

Playwright's sync API binds its objects to the thread that started
them — but tools execute on whatever worker thread the loop hands them
(`asyncio.to_thread` in the async agent). So every BrowserSession
operation funnels through a single-worker executor: exactly one thread
sees the traffic, whichever loop twin runs. The lifecycle state machine
is three words — nothing, open, closed — with close re-arming launch
and every action without a page saying so in model-readable words.

## What the tests pin

- snapshot rendering: title/source header, element lines, unlabeled
  elements clean, "(no interactive elements found)"
- head-tail clip on long pages; `[showing N of M]` element cap at 60
- click resolves `[data-yantra-ref]` and returns the REFRESHED page;
  fill types into textboxes, selects dropdown options by label, and
  refuses buttons with guidance; unknown ref lists known refs
- lifecycle: url-less open needs a page; second open reuses the page;
  close resets everything; reopen re-arms launch (proved by the
  missing-extra error firing again)
- launch paths: missing playwright names `yantra[browse]`;
  missing chromium binary names `playwright install chromium`;
  `file://` refused BEFORE any launch cost
- ONE worker thread sees all traffic, never the caller's thread
- profiles: profile set => launch_persistent_context on the dir with
  the context's existing page reused; unset => plain launch (both
  pinned via a fake chromium that records WHICH door was used);
  close shuts the context; the env knob reaches browser_tools() and
  all four verbs share that one session
- browser choice, headed mode and the unautomated login door have
  their own tests, listed in [notes/58](58-the-browser-you-already-have.md)
- login setup: headed launch + goto + wait_for_event('close'),
  playwright stopped even when waiting explodes, missing extra names
  `yantra[browse]`, file:// refused before any launch cost;
  CLI dispatch — no profile names $YANTRA_BROWSER_PROFILE (exit 2),
  a profile runs key-free to completion, --prompt/--build/--web
  combinations refused
- gating: all four NOT read_only; summaries name url/ref/text
- registration: without playwright 16 tools; with it 20 sharing ONE
  BrowserSession — the suite pins both worlds via the find_spec seam

## Receipts

Offline suite green — 699 passing WITHOUT playwright installed (the
fakes carry it), green again WITH the extra synced (and with `[web]`
alongside: uv syncs exactly the extras you name).

Live receipt (all traffic local, Ollama `qwen3.8` one-shot `--yolo
--tool-select 0`): a hand-written page served by `python -m http.server`
whose results div is EMPTY until its button's onclick builds the list —
and web_fetch on the same url provably ends at the word "Search"
('turbo' appears nowhere in its output; the script is stripped). The
model opened the page, typed `turbo` into the `[e1] textbox`, clicked
`[e2] button Search`, and read back the JS-built snapshot:
**"turbo encabulator -- $42.00"** — reported exactly that, end_turn.
`3419 in / 97 out · 4 iteration(s)`

Continued by [notes/58](58-the-browser-you-already-have.md), which
answers the walls this note admits to. `browser_close` is no longer the
only way the browser shuts: every turn closes it on the way out, because
a model with its answer does not tidy up
([notes/92](92-the-window-that-stayed-open.md)).
