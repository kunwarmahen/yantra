## A tool is three functions glued to a schema

```python
class Tool(ABC):
    name: str; description: str
    parameters: dict        # hand-written JSON Schema
    read_only: bool         # drives auto-approval
    def spec(self) -> ToolSpec
    def summary(self, args, ctx) -> str   # for the PERMISSION PROMPT
    def run(self, args, ctx) -> str       # returns output as text
```

**Lesson: write the schema by hand, with real descriptions.** Vague
schemas produce vague tool calls — the description strings are the model's
only documentation of the tool. `additionalProperties` and explicit
`required` matter more than they look.

## `summary()` takes the same `(args, ctx)` as `run()`

First version took only `args` and resolved paths against the *import-time*
cwd — previews showed different files than execution would touch. A
permission prompt you can't trust is worse than none. Fix: same context,
same resolution, so **what you approve is exactly what runs**.

Also learned defensively: a crashing `summary()` must never take down the
approval flow itself — `_execute` falls back to a generic preview.

## The sandbox is convenience confinement, NOT security

```python
def resolve_in_sandbox(ctx, raw):
    path = (ctx.cwd / raw).resolve()
    if not path.is_relative_to(ctx.cwd.resolve()):
        raise ToolError("path escapes sandbox")
```

This covers fs tools only. `bash` can `cd /` trivially — which is precisely
why bash is permission-gated rather than sandboxed. Say this honestly in
the docs instead of implying safety that isn't there. (Since this note was
written, a real containment layer arrived behind the same tool: the
pluggable `ToolSandbox`, bubblewrap when available —
[16-sandboxing.md](16-sandboxing.md).)

Two gotchas hit while writing it:

* `Path.resolve()` follows symlinks — do containment checks AFTER resolving,
  or `/tmp/link -> /etc/passwd` slips through.
* Tests for escape rejection must create the target file first if they also
  assert a successful sibling read (`is_relative_to` doesn't care about
  existence, humans reading the test do).

## Every cap exists because of one bad afternoon

| Cap | Value | Prevents |
|---|---|---|
| read_file | 256 KB / 2000 lines | one `cat huge.log` eating the context window |
| list_dir | 500 entries | dumping `/usr/lib` into history |
| grep | 200 matches | a broad regex flooding the transcript |
| bash output | 10k chars, head+tail | same, but errors live at the END |

Truncation style matters: keep **both ends** (`head + "\n[... N chars omitted
...]\n" + tail`). Tracebacks and error summaries are at the bottom; losing
them to head-only truncation hides the reason the command failed.

## bash timeout salvage

On `TimeoutExpired`: `os.killpg(pid, SIGKILL)` (the whole process group —
`start_new_session=True` made one), then call `process.communicate()` a
**second** time. subprocess docs guarantee retrying communication loses no
output; reading `process.stdout` directly races its reader threads and
returns nothing. Partial output from a killed command is still evidence the
model can use.

**Ctrl-C needs the same treatment.** Because the child is in its own
session, an interrupt during `communicate()` does NOT reach it — without
cleanup, `sleep 25` keeps running as an orphan after the turn is
cancelled. Fix found in live testing: a `except BaseException:` arm that
kills the group, reaps via `communicate()`, and re-raises (cancellation is
not a tool failure). Found by running the mid-turn Ctrl-C scenario against
a real model that happily requested `sleep 25`.

## Argument validation is part of the tool

Model-supplied arguments are untrusted input. `require_str` /
`require_int` raise `ToolError` with a message phrased for the MODEL to
read and correct ("argument 'offset' must be an integer, got str") — not
an assert, not a traceback.

## Stringified non-scalars: repair, don't reject

Models -- local ones especially, but not only -- routinely emit an array
or object argument as a STRING of JSON:

```
{"symbols": "[\"AAPL\"]"}      instead of      {"symbols": ["AAPL"]}
```

Nothing in the harness is mis-parsing when that happens, which is the
first thing to establish before going hunting. The wire genuinely
carried a string: `collect()` accumulates the streamed
`partial_json` fragments and calls `json.loads` exactly once, and a
`json.loads` of `{"symbols": "[...]"}` correctly yields a string. Pass
it on and an MCP server's validator says so precisely:

```
validating /properties/symbols: type: ["AAPL"] has type "string",
want one of "null, array"
```

Scalars survive (a stringified `"5"` is rarer, and plenty of servers
coerce it), so the symptom looks oddly selective: every tool with an
array parameter is broken, everything else works. That was a live
report against a commercial MCP server, and `todo_write.items` gave the
same shape at home -- so it was never MCP-specific.

The schema is right there and it says what was meant, so
`coerce_arguments` repairs it in `_gate`, before the summary is built:
the human approves, and hooks, execution and history all record, the
arguments that will actually run. Otherwise a resumed session replays
the broken form.

One rule keeps it honest: **never coerce a parameter whose schema also
accepts a string.** There a string is a legitimate value, and "looks
like JSON" is not permission to reinterpret it -- `grep`'s pattern
`[0-9]+` must stay the text the caller typed. Unstated types (including
bare `anyOf`) count as string-accepting for this purpose: a union nobody
reasoned about is not a licence to rewrite. Strings that do not parse,
or parse to the wrong shape (`'"AAPL"'` for an array), pass through
untouched so the tool's own validation still produces the honest
complaint. And a well-formed argument dict comes back as the SAME
object, so callers can detect a repair by identity.

## grep grew a ripgrep backend (one contract, two engines)

`search.py` now picks its engine per call:

1. **ripgrep subprocess** when an `rg` binary is on PATH -- production
   speed on big trees. Output parsed from `--json` events, streamed line
   by line so the 200-match cap stops reading the tree (`proc.kill()`)
   instead of slurping it.
2. **pure-Python `os.walk` fallback** -- unchanged original walker; also
   used whenever rg is unusable.

The subtle part is *when the fallback fires*. Not just "binary absent":

* rust's regex dialect lacks Python features (lookaheads, backrefs) --
  rg exits nonzero -> fall back rather than half-answer;
* any spawn/pipe failure -> same.

An empty result list and a failed backend are DIFFERENT values here:
`[]` means "genuinely no matches", `None` means "this engine couldn't
run -- try the other one".

Semantic parity was forced, not hoped for. The walker ignores
`.gitignore` (deterministic across machines), so ripgrep gets
`--no-ignore --hidden` plus `-g !dir` exclusions mirroring `SKIP_DIRS`
-- otherwise the two backends would silently disagree about which files
exist. Tests pin identical output format ('path:line: text'), the cap,
include-filtering, and skip rules on BOTH sides: existing grep tests run
engine-agnostic, new ones pin each backend (a fake `rg` script makes the
subprocess path hermetic). Verified live against real rg 14.1.1: both
engines return byte-identical matches on the same tree.

## memory.py: scratchpad + retrieval (notes that outlive compaction)

The context window is working memory; `write_note` / `recall_notes` are
long-term memory. The design pressure is compaction itself: masking and
summarizing DELIBERATELY discard old tool results, so anything expensive
to learn must be written down or it stops existing after an auto-compact.

* **One JSON file, not a note directory** (`.yantra/memory.json`,
  atomic tmp+replace writes). The model should never have to remember
  WHERE its memory lives — only WHAT it called things. Topics are keys;
  rewriting one is an upsert.
* **Retrieval is ranked substring match**, topics weighted above bodies.
  Vector search would add a dependency and a mystery for zero teaching
  value; "explainable and deterministic" beats "smart" for infrastructure
  a model has to debug its own use of.
* **recall with no query returns an index** (topic + preview) rather than
  dumping every full body: browse-then-fetch keeps the tool's output size
  proportional to what was actually asked.
* Empty memory answers with GUIDANCE ("no notes yet — write_note
  persists...") instead of empty string or error — same philosophy as
  edit_file's ambiguity message: the next caller is a model deciding
  what to do.
* Honest limits stated in the docstring: single-process (two harness
  processes sharing a sandbox can lose updates) and literal substring
  matching, which is exactly as smart as it sounds.

Verified live across PROCESSES: one session saved a deploy checklist via
write_note; a brand-new process recalled it by query — persistence is
the feature, so the verification crosses the boundary it claims to.

## ask_user: a tool can hold a service, not just do work

Every tool before this one closed over *state* (memory.json's path) or
*capabilities* (a sandbox). `ask_user` closes over a **service** — a
`UserChannel` with one blocking method, `ask()`, that returns whatever
the human said. The REPL injects stdin, the web UI injects a websocket
round-trip ([22-web-ui.md](22-web-ui.md)), tests inject a canned
answer; the tool object never knows which.

Three contract details that earned their keep:

* `read_only=True` — asking costs nothing and touches nothing, so it
  never triggers the permission gate in any frontend.
* Choices are capped at 6 with a ToolError beyond — an option list is a
  hint, not a menu, and the user can always type something else.
* The blocking is honest. Tools already run on worker threads, so
  "wait for a human" is just another slow IO — bounded by the human's
  patience rather than a timeout, which is right for a question worth
  stopping work over.

The headless case gets its own exception family, not an error result:
with `channel=None` (piped stdin, cron, evals) a call raises
`UserUnavailable` — a deliberate `BaseException` so the loop's
convert-failures-to-data rule cannot hand the model a "no user found"
note it would try to explain away with a guess. Nobody home is not the
model's problem to fix.

## Two ways to take a tool away: unregister vs disable

The registry grew a second removal spelling after the first one met the
UI ([22-web-ui.md](22-web-ui.md)). They answer different questions:

* **`unregister(name)`** — gone for good; the operator's startup
  kill-switch (`YANTRA_DISABLED_TOOLS`,
  [17-tool-selection.md](17-tool-selection.md)) uses it before any
  catalog is built.
* **`disable(name)` / `enable(name)`** — reversible and mid-session:
  the tool stays registered but hidden behind a live-checked set.
  `specs()` drops it from the next request, `get()` refuses with a
  DISTINCT message ("disabled by the operator", not "no such tool" —
  the model should be able to tell an operator decision from its own
  hallucination), `disabled_names()` reports it sorted, and
  re-registering or unregistering clears the flag.

The design rule that made this safe to expose mid-turn: **every check
is consulted LIVE, never baked in**. Nothing snapshots the disabled set
at wire-up time; selection, discovery, and execution all ask
`is_disabled()` per call, so flipping a switch takes effect on the very
next request — including one already in flight. The failure mode is
deliberately data, not an exception: a model calling a just-disabled
tool gets the refusal as a tool result and picks another route, exactly
like a denied permission.

## A tool does not have to live in this tree

Everything above describes the sixteen built-ins, but nothing in it is
specific to them. An agent package ships its own `Tool` subclasses in a
`tools/` folder and they register alongside these
([32-package-tools.md](32-package-tools.md)) — same base class, same
hand-written schema, same `read_only` declaration driving the same gate.

Which is where this note's central claim got its real test. Every
framework in this space offers a `@tool` decorator that reads a function
signature and generates the JSON Schema, and the obvious moment to add
one is the moment strangers start writing tools. Yantra does not, for
the reason argued at the top: a signature cannot say *search what
archive*, and a schema that does not say it produces a model that
guesses. The sugar would have cost one minute of typing per tool and
bought a worse agent — so discovery is the only thing that is new.
