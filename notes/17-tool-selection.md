# 17 — Dynamic tool loading: BM25 against the tool cliff

*Companion to [notes/04](04-tools.md) (the registry) and
[notes/09](09-mcp.md) (where tool counts explode). Book ch12.*

## The problem in numbers

Selection accuracy is roughly flat to ~10 tools, visibly degraded by
20, and falls off a cliff between 30 and 50 — while every tool's schema
burns 100–500 tokens PER REQUEST. MCP makes 50 trivially easy: three
modest servers and you are past the cliff before the first user
message. The fix is to stop treating "which tools does the model see"
as static configuration and treat it as a RETRIEVAL problem, solved
per turn.

## Why BM25 and not embeddings

Queries come from the agent itself (its own transcript), so they share
vocabulary with tool descriptions — lexical overlap is the signal.
BM25 is ~60 lines with zero dependencies (`tools/selector.py`), fully
deterministic for tests, and swapping in embeddings later means
replacing exactly one method (`ToolCatalog.scores`). `k1=1.5`
(term-frequency saturation) is the textbook default; `b` (length
normalization) is NOT — it runs at 0.30 against a textbook 0.75,
because tool descriptions are written to a length their author chose
and the longest in a family is usually the entry point. At 0.75 that
entry point loses to its own siblings
([notes/60](60-the-tool-that-explained-itself.md)).

Tokenization splits on non-`[a-z0-9_]` so snake_case survives intact —
`post_message` stays one term, which matters because tool names ARE the
vocabulary: a tool the model has already called puts its exact name in
the transcript and retrieves itself next turn. Each name is ALSO
indexed in pieces (`name_parts`), because the whole-name spelling
matches nothing a human writes — nobody types `browser_open`, they type
"open the browser".

## The score floor is the design

`select(query, k)` returns pins + positive-scoring tools only. A query
nothing matches returns JUST the pins — never filler ranked last,
because a filler ranked last still teaches the model a wrong tool
exists. Pins come from `catalog.must_include` (default: `CORE_PINS` +
`list_available_tools`, resolved against what is actually registered);
a caller can pass its own set via `enable_selection(registry,
pins=(...))` or none.

## Why the core is PINNED, not retrieved

Retrieval ranks descriptions against conversation vocabulary — but the
autonomy loop's floor doesn't describe the TASK, it enables every
task. Ask "fix this bug in parser.py" and `write_file`'s description
shares not one word with the query; BM25 correctly drops it, exactly
when the turn needs it next. So six tools beat the query and load
every turn regardless of score (`selector.CORE_PINS`): read_file,
write_file, edit_file, bash, glob, grep — plus the discovery hatch.
`load_skill` makes seven in a project that has skills (it is skipped
when nothing registered it), for the same reason read from the other
end: the roster in the system prompt *promises* the model it can load
any skill named there, and a promise BM25 can drop is a promise broken
on exactly the vague opening turns skills are written for
([30-skills.md](30-skills.md)). That arithmetic sets the auto-enable
width: `DEFAULT_TOOLS_PER_TURN = 12` leaves four or five slots for the
retrieved long tail (MCP servers, browser, background jobs), which is
what selection was for in the first place.

## Three pieces

| Piece | Job |
|---|---|
| `ToolCatalog` | index over name+description; `select()` with floor |
| `query_from_transcript(history)` | first user message = session anchor; recent assistant text + **tool-call names** track the current sub-task. Names matter most at pivots: having called `mcp__db__run_query` puts db vocabulary into the query BEFORE any prose about databases exists |
| `ListAvailableTools` | the pinned discovery hatch: lists the FULL catalog on demand, optional substring filter |

The discovery tool closes the two holes retrieval alone cannot:
vague openers where everything scores zero, and mid-task pivots whose
new vocabulary hasn't reached the transcript yet — the model can ASK
what exists instead of guessing. (Execution-side, guessing is now
harmless — soft admission runs any real name — but harmless guesses
still waste a call; the hatch lets the model look before it leaps.)
Its description teaches the contract explicitly: *a tool discovered here
becomes usable from YOUR NEXT TURN* — when its name sits in history and
BM25 surfaces it naturally.

## The seam cuts once: selection caps what gets SENT

The original design cut twice — unselected tools were also
unexecutable, and a hidden-but-real call got an error teaching the
discovery path (*"call list_available_tools"*). Live use broke that.
The model names tools it legitimately knows: from an earlier listing,
from resumed history, or because `write_file` is simply what every
model has in its weights. Punishing exact knowledge with a failed
round-trip taught nothing, burned an iteration, and weaker local
models thrashed on the retry dance — one session lost several turns
to *"write_file exists but is not loaded this turn."*

So execution now SOFT-ADMITS (`_get_visible_tool`): a call naming a
real but unselected tool joins `_turn_tools` on the spot and runs THIS
turn. Permission gating is unchanged — admission only bypasses the
retrieval cap, never the seatbelt. And it converges by itself: the
executed name lands in history, which feeds the next selection query,
so BM25 keeps it ranked from here on without any special casing.

That leaves exactly one failure mode, and it's the honest one:
a genuinely hallucinated name still errors as data ("no such tool").
Selection stays what it should be — a context-economy decision about
what to SEND — rather than a second permission system.

The loop has one more input most designs miss: **recent tool RESULTS
join the query too** (truncated). A discovery answer is a user-role
ToolResult full of tool names; if results didn't feed back, the
promised "listed here → surfaced next step" would silently fail — the
live session proved it before the fix (model listed the tools, then
correctly reported it still couldn't call them). Results are capped at
~400 chars each and only from the recent window, so a noisy bash
output can't drown the query.

Without a catalog everything is byte-identical to before (pinned by
`test_no_catalog_keeps_full_registry`).

## Wiring

```
uv run yantra --tool-select 12    # force width K
                                   # auto-enables at 12 above 20 tools otherwise
uv run yantra --tool-select 0     # opt out of the auto-enable
YANTRA_TOOLS_PER_TURN=12          # .env spelling of the same switch
```

## Trimming the toolset entirely

Selection decides what fits in a request; sometimes you want a tool to
not exist. Two spellings, for two lifetimes:

**Startup kill-switch (permanent).** `YANTRA_DISABLED_TOOLS` takes
comma-separated glob patterns matched against tool names and UNREGISTERS
matches after MCP servers connect but before any catalog is built — so a
disabled tool is never sent, never executed, never suggested by
`list_available_tools`, and never pinned:

```bash
# hide one family ...
YANTRA_DISABLED_TOOLS=browser_open,browser_click,browser_fill,browser_close
# ... or one tool, or a whole MCP server
YANTRA_DISABLED_TOOLS=web_fetch,mcp__slack__*
```

A pattern matching nothing prints a warning — typos should be loud.
The registry's `unregister(name)` is the primitive; the env var is just
the operator-facing spelling.

**Mid-session pulls (reversible).** `registry.disable(name)` /
`enable(name)` keep the tool registered but hide it behind a set that
every layer consults LIVE ([04-tools.md](04-tools.md)): `_specs_for_request`
drops the schema from the very next request, the execution choke point
(`_get_visible_tool`) answers a call to it with error-data saying
"disabled by the operator", `catalog.select` skips it **even when
pinned** (a static pin list must not resurrect what the operator pulled),
and the discovery hatch never suggests it. This is the machinery behind
the web UI's tools panel and the REPL's `/tools off|on NAME|GLOB`
([06-cli.md](06-cli.md)) — flips land mid-turn, on purpose, by the same
argument as `/api/permissions`: the layers poll per call, so there is no
unsafe moment. Unlike the kill-switch these die with the session;
nothing is written to disk.

`enable_selection(registry)` wires the live check once (`catalog.hidden =
registry.is_disabled`, same for discovery) and is idempotent: a second
call re-points the live discovery instance at the rebuilt index instead
of colliding. The wiring goes through registry ITERATION rather than
`get()` — deliberately, since `get()` now refuses disabled tools, and
the discovery hatch must stay findable even when itself disabled.

Below `AUTO_SELECTION_THRESHOLD = 20` don't bother (book's rule);
MCP tools need nothing special — they are plain `Tool`s by the time
they reach the registry ([notes/09](09-mcp.md)).

Sub-agents keep validating against the FULL registry: children get
small explicit tool lists already; selection is a wide-catalog cure.

## Honest scope

**Descriptions are retrieval documents — write them like it.** Live
receipt: against 24 tools, the query "Use an MCP tool to add 2 and 3"
surfaced six ECHO tools and no add tool, because echo's description
says "proving an MCP round trip works" (matching `an`, `mcp`, `the`)
while add's says only "Add two integers." That is BM25 being correct,
not broken: the user's vocabulary met the echo description more often.
Two consequences: (1) tool authors should put the task-domain words in
descriptions; (2) this exact failure is why the discovery hatch is PINNED —
the live model noticed the mismatch and called `list_available_tools`
on its own.

Which is also why discovery must be FRICTIONLESS: `confirm_gate` never
prompts for read-only tools, because a permission wall in front of the
hatch turns every discovery question into a dead end.

The honest cost ledger: per-turn selection still trades a little
context certainty for a lot of context economy. A tool outside the
pins can be missed in the SENT set on its first use — soft admission
makes that miss cheap (the call runs anyway) rather than free, and
description quality decides how often it happens at all.
