# Yantra — a framework for building agents

Yantra is the machinery behind tools like Claude Code, packaged so you
can build your own agent with it: an agentic loop around a chat model, a
JSON-Schema tool system, a permission gate, skills, sub-agents, MCP,
sandboxing and hand-parsed streaming — **without SDKs, pydantic, or
heavyweight frameworks**. Runtime deps: `httpx` and `rich` only;
optional extras add a browser UI (`fastapi` + `uvicorn`, `[web]`) and
real-browser tools (`playwright`, `[browse]`) — each installs only what
it needs.

Cloud models and local ones are both first-class. Point it at
Anthropic, any OpenAI-compatible gateway, the Responses API, or an
Ollama box on hardware you own — the same agent, the same tools, no
code changes.

[TUTORIAL.md](TUTORIAL.md) walks the whole thing end to end — every
layer in the order the pieces make sense, what to type to see each one
working, and an hour-long path you can follow against a local model.
[`notes/`](notes/) is the per-topic write-up of how every layer works;
[notes/00-guided-tour.md](notes/00-guided-tour.md) is the plain-English
tour, with diagrams.

## Status

The harness underneath is complete and covered by 1346 tests. The
framework layer on top — agents you define as a folder of files, tools
and sub-agents declared in that folder, evals as an acceptance gate you
can run without a key — is built and in use, and the API is not stable
yet.

## Provenance and license

Yantra began as a fork of
[AksharaHarness](https://github.com/kunwarmahen/aksharaharness), a
from-scratch harness written to learn how harnesses work. That repo
stays what it is: a tutorial you can read end to end. This one takes the
same machinery and builds a framework on top, which means it is free to
break things a teaching repo cannot afford to break.

## Setup

Working *on* Yantra:

```bash
uv sync                          # creates .venv from pyproject.toml
cp .env.example .env             # then fill in a key (never committed)
```

Building *with* Yantra, from another project. Yantra installs from git
rather than PyPI — the name is taken there by an unrelated package:

```bash
uv add git+https://github.com/kunwarmahen/yantra
# or: pip install git+https://github.com/kunwarmahen/yantra
# pin it for anything reproducible:
uv add "yantra @ git+https://github.com/kunwarmahen/yantra@v0.1.0"
```

`.env` is loaded automatically (a ~15-line loader in `config.py` — no
python-dotenv dependency); real environment variables still win.

`.env` variables per provider (`PREFIX` = `ANTHROPIC`, `OPENAI`,
`RESPONSES`, or `OLLAMA`):

| Var | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `{PREFIX}_API_KEY` | secret (Anthropic also accepts `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`; Ollama needs none) |
| `{PREFIX}_BASE_URL` | Anthropic: excludes `/v1` · OpenAI-style (incl. ollama + responses): INCLUDES `/v1` |
| `{PREFIX}_MODEL` | default model slug |
| `{PREFIX}_CONTEXT_WINDOW` | window assumption for compaction (default 200000 cloud / 8192 ollama) |

Any OpenAI-compatible gateway works as `OPENAI_BASE_URL`; gateways that
also speak the Messages dialect work under `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`; the
Responses dialect (`RESPONSES_*`) targets OpenAI directly, OpenRouter's
stateless beta, or a local Ollama >= 0.13.3 — all on the same `/v1`
surface ([notes/19](notes/19-responses-api.md)).

## Usage

```bash
uv run yantra --agent ./researcher                   # run an AGENT PACKAGE (see below)
uv run yantra                                        # REPL (provider auto-guessed from keys)
uv run yantra --provider openai                      # pick a dialect explicitly
uv run yantra --provider ollama                      # LOCAL models (localhost:11434, no key)
uv run yantra --provider ollama --model qwen3.8      # any tag you have pulled
uv run yantra --yolo                                 # no permission prompts (careful)
                                                      #   ...and /yolo flips it back
                                                      #   mid-session (web UI: mode chip)
uv run yantra --cache                                # prompt-cache breakpoints on
uv run yantra --max-usd 0.50                         # stop a turn once it costs this much
uv run yantra --resume                               # restore the newest checkpoint
uv run yantra --env-context local                    # machine facts only (default: full)
uv run yantra --skills-dir ~/shared-skills           # extra skills root (repeatable)
uv run yantra --no-skills                            # ignore skills entirely
                                                      #   ...and /skills off NAME
                                                      #   pulls one mid-session
uv run yantra "summarize README.md"                  # one-shot prompt, then exit
uv run yantra --image photo.png "what's in this picture?"   # vision one-shot
```

### It knows where (and when) it is

Sessions start aware instead of clueless: the system prompt carries your
time and timezone, host and working directory — and, by default, your
city from ONE public-IP lookup at startup. Ask *"what's the temperature
outside?"* and it answers for where you actually are, fetching the
weather with its own tools — it doesn't burn a turn asking which city
you're in. The same prompt tells it to try its tools before asking you
for any fact it could discover itself; questions stay reserved for what
only you know — preferences, permissions, irreversible calls.

Three levels (`YANTRA_ENV_CONTEXT` / `--env-context` set the start,
`/env` or the web UI's env chip flip it live):

| level | what the agent gets |
|---|---|
| `full` *(default)* | machine facts **+ your city** — one keyless lookup to ipinfo.io per session |
| `local` | machine facts only; nothing leaves the machine beyond the chat itself |
| `off` | nothing injected — asks you everything, as before |

One honest tradeoff on `full`: your city rides inside every request sent
to your LLM provider. If you'd rather share nothing, `local` or `off`.

### It can learn your procedures (skills)

Some knowledge is yours, not the model's: how *this* repo reviews a PR,
the three files everyone forgets when adding a feature, the release
steps in the order that actually works. Write it down once, in a folder,
and the agent picks it up **only when the work calls for it**:

```
skills/new-tool/
├── SKILL.md        instructions, with a short header saying what it's for
└── template.py     referenced by the instructions, read only if needed
```

```markdown
---
name: new-tool
description: Add a new built-in tool to this harness -- schema, summary,
  run, registration, permission gating, tests and docs. Use when asked to
  add, write, or wire up a tool that the model can call.
---

# Adding a tool to Yantra
1. Read the neighbours first. `src/yantra/tools/glob.py` is the...
```

Nothing else to wire up — drop the folder in and start a session. Only
the name and description ride in the prompt (~25 tokens each); the
instructions arrive as a tool result when the model calls `load_skill`,
and bundled files only if the instructions send it there. Ten skills
cost you a rounding error per turn and the right one shows up in full,
on demand.

It works on local models too — here is `qwen3.8-64k` through Ollama,
with a prompt that never says the word *skill*:

```
$ uv run yantra --provider ollama --prompt "What would I have to change
    to add a count_lines tool to this project? Just the checklist."

skills: 2 loaded -- new-tool, notes-entry
→ load_skill()
  3. Register it — add to default_registry(), extend __all__, and bump
     the docstring count ("Sixteen built-ins…") in tools/__init__.py.
```

That last detail is in nobody's training data. It is in `SKILL.md`,
because someone got bitten by it once and wrote it down.

| where | for |
|---|---|
| `skills/` | the set your repo commits |
| `.yantra/skills/` | private overrides (gitignored) |
| `~/.yantra/skills/` | yours, on every project |
| `--skills-dir` / `$YANTRA_SKILLS_PATH` | explicit, wins over all of them |

A skill can also declare `mode: subagent`, and then its `allowed-tools`
stop being advice: the instructions run in a **fresh child agent** built
with exactly those tools and nothing else, and only its conclusion comes
back. Use it where isolation is the point — a survey that must not be
able to write, an audit you want provably read-only.

In the REPL: `/skills` lists them (with what broke and what got loaded),
`/skills NAME` prints one without spending a turn, `/skills off deploy-*`
pulls one mid-session the way `/tools off` pulls a tool (and
`$YANTRA_DISABLED_SKILLS` never loads them at all), `/skills reload`
re-scans after an edit, and `/new-tool add a count_lines tool` runs one
directly. The web UI gets a skills section in the tools panel — switches to
turn one off, and an editor (＋ new, or `edit` on any row) that writes a
real `SKILL.md` for you, validated by the same loader before it saves. Full design notes, including why the roster is frozen and what
`allowed-tools` does *not* do: [notes/30](notes/30-skills.md).

### One-command starts

`start.sh` wraps the common setups so you don't have to remember flags.
Run it bare for a numbered menu, or name what you want:

```bash
./start.sh                    # menu — pick by number
./start.sh local              # free & private: Ollama, no key needed
./start.sh cloud              # uses whichever API key your .env has
./start.sh web                # chat in your browser (foreground)
./start.sh local-web          # Ollama + browser UI

./start.sh web-start          # browser UI in the BACKGROUND (web-start
./start.sh web-stop           #   local' pins Ollama) — plus stop,
./start.sh web-status         #   status, restart and web-logs to
./start.sh web-logs           #   follow its output

./start.sh container          # podman/docker: one build + run (menu:
./start.sh container start    #   start, stop, status, rebuild, restart,
./start.sh container stop     #   logs, yes to auto-approve)
```

Everything after the preset passes straight through (`./start.sh local
--yolo`, `./start.sh cloud --resume`, `./start.sh web-start --port 9000`).
Keys, models and URLs still come from `.env`; the script only adds the
flags that make each setup different. It needs `curl` for its health
checks — nothing else beyond bash and uv.

### Run in a container (podman/docker)

The UI can also run inside a container — handy to keep the agent's
hands off your real filesystem entirely, or to put it on an always-on
box. The image carries code only; keys arrive at run time.

The easy road is `./start.sh container start`: it builds the image if
missing, runs it detached, and waits until the UI answers at `/`.
Nothing else is ever stopped to make room — if the default **port 8321**
is already serving your other server, it simply picks the next free one
(8322–8342) and keeps 8321 untouched, and an explicit `--port` that is
busy is refused. `./start.sh container` opens a menu (start / stop /
status / restart / logs, plus `yes` to auto-approve tool calls).
`--model`, `--timeout`, `--max-turns` pass through; `stop` needs no
arguments — it always targets the container this script started.

Prefer the raw commands? Same image, your own port choices:

```bash
podman build --format docker -t localhost/yantra-web .
# (--format docker so the HEALTHCHECK survives; OCI images ignore it)

# cloud road: mount your .env read-only (or pass -e ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...).
# --userns=keep-id lets the in-container user read your 600-perm .env.
podman run -d --name yantra-web --userns=keep-id -p 8400:8321 \
    -v ./.env:/app/.env:ro localhost/yantra-web

# local road: reach Ollama on the HOST via its special name. The
# trailing flags compose with the image's entrypoint; --provider is
# needed because env vars alone don't tip the key-based guess.
podman run -d --name yantra-local -p 8401:8321 \
    -e OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://host.containers.internal:11434/v1 \
    -e OLLAMA_MODEL=qwen3.8 \
    localhost/yantra-web --web --host 0.0.0.0 --provider ollama

# your own skills: the image ships this repo's set, yours ride a mount
podman run -d --name yantra-web --userns=keep-id -p 8400:8321 \
    -v ./.env:/app/.env:ro -v ./skills:/app/skills:ro localhost/yantra-web

podman logs -f yantra-web        # watch it boot
curl -s -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://localhost:8400/
```

Notes worth knowing:

* **Port 8321 is fixed inside** (the health check probes it); publish it
  wherever you like with `-p`.
* **The tools run in the container**, not on your machine — `read_file`
  sees `/app`, so give it a workspace if you want it to touch your
  files: mount one and add args after the image name (they compose):
  `-v ./workspace:/workspace localhost/yantra-web --web --cwd /workspace`.
* **Sessions live in `/app/.yantra/`** and vanish with the container;
  add `-v yantra-state:/app/.yantra` to keep checkpoints across runs.
* Docker users: swap `podman` → `docker`, and replace
  `host.containers.internal` with `host.docker.internal`.

Builder mode ([notes/18](notes/18-builder-mode.md)): spec → files →
acceptance checks re-run INDEPENDENTLY (never trusting the model's
word); a red verification is fed back into the same conversation for a
bounded repair round (default 2), then BUILD GREEN/RED. Exit code
doubles as a CI gate. Test files are checksummed — a repair job that
edits them fails the build even if the suite then passes, and tampering
is never repaired:

```bash
uv run yantra --build "CLI that converts between temperature units"   # BUILD GREEN → exit 0
uv run yantra --build --cwd somewhere/seeded "repair the broken CLI"
```

Bash sandboxing ([notes/16](notes/16-sandboxing.md)) — `--sandbox`
picks bubblewrap when usable (network off by default, host filesystem
invisible outside read-only system paths, env scrubbed of secrets,
timed-out process trees fully reaped) and falls back to the legacy
scrubbed-env subprocess otherwise:

```bash
uv run yantra --sandbox                    # autodetect (bwrap > subprocess)
uv run yantra --sandbox none               # explicit legacy behavior
```

Dynamic tool loading ([notes/17](notes/17-tool-selection.md)) — past
~20 tools the model's selection accuracy hits the cliff, so per turn
only the top-K best-matching tools are SENT (BM25 over name +
description). The autonomy loop's floor always loads regardless of
matching — `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `bash`, `glob`,
`grep` plus the `list_available_tools` discovery hatch — and calling
any real tool by its exact name loads it on the spot, so a selection
miss costs nothing:

```bash
uv run yantra --mcp-config big.json --tool-select 12   # force width K
uv run yantra --tool-select 0                          # opt out of auto-enable
# (.env equivalent: YANTRA_TOOLS_PER_TURN=12)
```

Trim tools you never want — not sent, not executed, not even suggested
by discovery ([.env.example](.env.example)):

```bash
YANTRA_DISABLED_TOOLS=browser_*,mcp__slack__*   # comma-separated globs on tool names
```

That kill-switch is permanent (tools unregistered at startup). To pull
a tool for just this session and put it back later: `/tools off bash`,
`/tools on bash` in the REPL — globs work (`/tools off browser_*`) —
or the switches in the web UI's tools panel. Both take effect
immediately, even mid-turn ([notes/17](notes/17-tool-selection.md)).

Arguments are repaired against the tool's own schema before anything
runs: models often emit an array or object as a *string* of JSON
(`{"symbols": "[\"AAPL\"]"}`), which breaks every array-taking tool
until somebody parses it back. A parameter that could legitimately BE a
string is never touched — `grep`'s `[0-9]+` stays text
([notes/04](notes/04-tools.md#stringified-non-scalars-repair-dont-reject)).

MCP servers (hand-rolled JSON-RPC — no SDK; stdio and Streamable-HTTP
transports, picked by config shape). Config file, repeatable flag; tools
register as `mcp__<server>__<tool>`:

```json
{"servers": {"tiny":  {"command": "python",
                       "args": ["examples/tiny_mcp_server.py"]},
             "remote": {"url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"},
             "paid":   {"url": "https://example.com/mcp",
                        "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer ${MY_TOKEN}"}}}}
```

```bash
uv run yantra --mcp-config mcp.json          # connect + discover at startup
python examples/tiny_mcp_server.py --http     # the same server over Streamable HTTP
```

Over HTTP every request after the handshake carries the negotiated
`MCP-Protocol-Version` header (spec 2025-06-18) — strict remote servers
reject clients that omit it — and a refused version hands the connection
straight back instead of leaking it. Servers behind a token take a
`headers` map — the HTTP transport's answer to stdio's `env` — whose
values may reference the environment, so the secret never lands in a
config file:

```json
{"servers": {"paid": {"url": "https://example.com/mcp",
                      "headers": {"Authorization": "Bearer ${MY_TOKEN}"}}}}
```

`${MY_TOKEN}` resolves at connect time (unset ⇒ a named error, never a
blank `Bearer`), and `remember` stores the placeholder rather than the
token.

Servers that only issue tokens through a login — most commercial ones —
get the spec's OAuth 2.1 flow instead, hand-rolled like everything else
here (discovery → dynamic registration → PKCE in your browser → refresh):

```bash
uv run yantra --mcp-login vendor --mcp-config vendor.json
```

The panel's 🔑 on any http row does the same from the browser you already
have open. Tokens land in `~/.local/state/yantra/mcp-tokens.json` at
mode 0600 — never in the working directory — and refresh themselves,
including one retry when a server disagrees with our expiry arithmetic
([notes/09](notes/09-mcp.md#remote-servers-that-want-a-token)).

Servers are runtime furniture, not just startup wiring: `/mcp` lists
them, `/mcp add NAME URL` (or `NAME COMMAND [ARGS...]`) connects one
mid-session — asking whether to remember it in `.yantra/mcp.json` for
future launches — and `/mcp off|on NAME` / `/mcp remove NAME` toggle or
tear down. The web panel's "servers & tools" section does the same:
health dots, add-by-form or paste-JSON, per-server switches, remove.
Disabling keeps the process warm; removing kills it and forgets any
saved entry. Paste-JSON takes the same `{"servers": {...}}` object as
the config file above — several servers in one go, each reporting its
own success or failure — through the same parser, so the two can't
drift. For a click-by-click first run (one terminal, a local model, and
the three traps that bite everyone once) see
[notes/09 · trying it in the portal](notes/09-mcp.md#trying-it-in-the-portal-end-to-end).

Sub-agents (agent-as-tool: fresh-context children with a filtered tool
catalog, per-session spawn budget, compact results — child streams tee
to the terminal live):

```bash
uv run yantra --subagents "research X and report back"
```

Browser UI ([notes/22](notes/22-web-ui.md)) — `--web` serves the same
agent loop at `http://127.0.0.1:8321` (`--host`/`--port` to move it):
streamed replies and thinking rendered as markdown (headings, tables,
code blocks — by a ~150-line escape-first renderer, no library), tool
cards, permission prompts with approve/deny/**edit**, image attachments,
save/load/compact/model switches, a permission-mode chip (ask ⇄ yolo,
switchable mid-turn like the REPL's `/yolo`), a tools panel (every
registered tool, switchable off/on mid-run like the REPL's `/tools`)
with an MCP servers section above it — health dots, add by form or
paste-JSON, per-server switches, remove; same powers as `/mcp`
mid-session, and remembered servers auto-reconnect on future launches,
a live context-pressure meter (amber at 60%, red at 80% — where
auto-compaction starts caring) with a per-turn **budget bar** beside it
when there is a ceiling (`$0.07 left`, moving mid-turn; `free` where a
local model means it can never fire), and a ■ Stop button that lands
mid-sentence, not just between tool calls (Esc works too). The whole
surface runs on one token-driven design system — light and dark from
your OS or from the appearance button, in-page dialogs rather than the
browser's own, and a layout that reflows to one column on a phone.
Install the extra once: `uv sync --extra web`.

```bash
uv run yantra --provider ollama --web      # local model + browser UI
uv run yantra --web                        # provider auto-guessed, as usual
```

The `ask_user` tool rides along in every surface: when the model hits a
question only you can answer ("Postgres or SQLite?", "may I delete
it?"), it pauses mid-turn and asks — numbered choices plus free text at
the terminal prompt, a modal in the browser — then proceeds on your
answer. With no interactive terminal attached (piped stdin, cron,
evals), asking fails the turn loudly rather than guessing; history
stays resumable for a later interactive run ([notes/22](notes/22-web-ui.md)).

Evals (trajectory-level, real model, costs money — merge/nightly
cadence, not per-commit; exit code doubles as a CI gate):

```bash
uv run yantra --agent ./researcher --eval             # a package's own gate
uv run yantra --agent ./researcher --eval --repeat 5  # ... judged on the pass rate
uv run yantra --agent ./researcher --eval --case "flaky-*" --repeat 10   # aimed
uv run yantra --agent ./researcher --eval --case "has-no-*"  # no key, no tokens
uv run yantra --agent ./researcher --eval --report a.json --against b.json
uv run --env-file .env python examples/run_evals.py   # this harness's own suite
uv run --env-file .env python examples/run_evals.py --async   # same, concurrent
```

A case that only asserts the tool *list* (`lacks_tools = ["write_file"]`)
needs no task and reaches no model, so that part of a gate is free and
fast enough for every push ([notes/35](notes/35-roster-and-pass-rates.md)).

Images ([notes/15](notes/15-images.md)): `--image PATH` (repeatable)
attaches png/jpeg/gif/webp files (≤5 MB each) to a one-shot prompt;
in the REPL, `/image PATH...` stages them onto your *next* message
(`/image` alone shows the stage, `/image clear` unstages). The loader
base64-encodes before any turn starts — a bad path errors at attach
time, never mid-conversation; both adapters carry the resulting
`ImageBlock` in their own dialect, and compaction bills images by
decoded size.

Self-reliance tools — the difference between an agent that answers
and one that finishes ([notes/23](notes/23-glob.md)–
[27](notes/27-read-image.md)):

- **glob** finds files by NAME (`**` recursion, newest-first) without
  a permission-gated bash call; **grep** still searches contents.
- **todo_write / todo_read** keep live plan state (`.yantra/todos.json`,
  replace-whole-list semantics) — distinct from write_note's durable
  facts, and cheap grounding that keeps local models on script through
  long missions.
- **web_fetch URL** pulls one http(s) address as readable text (HTML
  stripped to prose, JSON pretty-printed, 2 MB download cap). Fetch,
  not search — and deliberately NOT read_only: it reaches the network
  from outside every sandbox wall, so it gates like bash and a human
  approves the address.
- **bash_start / bash_poll / bash_kill** run commands that outlive one
  tool call — dev servers, watchers, long builds — with output teeing
  to `.yantra/jobs/<id>.log`. Jobs always run as plain env-scrubbed
  subprocesses (they outlive any sandbox), so start/kill gate even when
  confined bash doesn't.
- **read_image PATH** lets the model LOOK at a png/jpeg/gif/webp in
  its sandbox — screenshots, diagrams, charts it just generated. The
  image rides history right after the tool result on all three wire
  dialects ([notes/27](notes/27-read-image.md)).
- **browser_open / browser_click / browser_fill / browser_close**
  drive a real headless Chromium (`[browse]` optional extra:
  `uv sync --extra browse && uv run playwright install chromium`).
  JavaScript runs, so JS-rendered apps work where web_fetch sees an
  empty shell; every action returns readable prose plus numbered
  element refs (`[e1]`, `[e2]`, …) harvested from the live DOM, and
  clicks/fills take a ref and return the refreshed page. Same egress
  rule as web_fetch — all four gate. Installing the extra IS the
  opt-in: the four register only when playwright is present
  ([notes/28](notes/28-browser-tools.md)). Logins persist too: set
  `YANTRA_BROWSER_PROFILE=~/.local/state/yantra/browser-profile`
  and run `uv run yantra --browse-login <url>` once — a visible
  window opens, you sign in yourself (2FA included), close it — and
  every later session starts signed-in. Cookies never enter model
  context: the profile holds them on disk, outside the conversation.

REPL commands: `/help /model /provider /tools /history /usage /save /load
/compact /clear /image /build /quit` (`//text` sends a literal leading slash; a
trailing `\` continues the same message on the next line — paste-friendly
multi-line input that keeps indentation). `/tools` lists the toolset;
`/tools off|on NAME|GLOB` pulls tools out (and back) mid-session.
Ctrl-C cancels the current turn, not the session. `/build TASK` runs a child
builder agent in its own workspace and reports BUILD GREEN/RED without
touching this session's history. `/save`+`--resume` persist
sessions to `.yantra/session.sqlite3` (append-only versions);
`/compact` force-clears context pressure — auto-compaction also fires by
itself at 80% of the window (`--context-window` to set it; the web UI's
meter shows the same number live).

Cost accounting ([notes/21](notes/21-cost-accounting.md)): the turn
footer and `/usage` show approximate dollars from a built-in list-price
table (current Claude + GPT slugs, snapshot-dated), summed over
per-model buckets so mid-session model switches price correctly. An
unknown slug shows NO figure — never `$0`. Prices drift; point
`YANTRA_PRICES` at a JSON file to override or extend:

```json
{"my-model": {"input": 3.0, "output": 15.0},
 "vendor/slug*": {"input": 1.0, "output": 2.0, "cached_read": 0.1}}
```

The billing convention underneath: usage counters are disjoint
(`input_tokens` counts full-rate tokens only — OpenAI-dialect adapters
subtract cached hits out of the wire's prompt total), so cached tokens
are never billed twice, and `Usage.window_tokens()` is what fills the
context window.

Library use:

```python
from yantra import Agent, allow_read_only, default_registry, get_provider, load_settings

agent = Agent(get_provider("anthropic", load_settings("anthropic")),
              model="claude-sonnet-4-5", tools=default_registry(),
              permissions=allow_read_only)          # read-only tools run free

# opt in to sub-agents: two objects, wired to each other
from yantra.subagent import SpawnSubagent, SubagentSpawner
spawner = SubagentSpawner(agent)                    # per-session budget lives here
agent.registry.register(SpawnSubagent(spawner))     # the model now sees the tool

print(agent.run("what's in README.md?").message.text())

# async: one event loop, many independent conversations
import asyncio
from yantra.async_agent import AsyncAgent

async def main():
    provider = get_provider("anthropic", load_settings("anthropic"))
    agents = [AsyncAgent(provider, model="claude-sonnet-4-5")
              for _ in range(4)]
    replies = await asyncio.gather(*(a.run(q) for a, q in zip(agents, QUESTIONS)))

asyncio.run(main())
```

A gate may be async, which is what lets the person who approves a tool
call be somewhere other than this keyboard. It suspends only its own
conversation — the other three keep running:

```python
async def ask_the_owner(request):                 # a gate that WAITS
    answer = await send_to_chat(request.summary)  # minutes, if they are out
    if not answer.approved:
        request.reason = "your owner refused this: bash is off in chat."
    return answer.approved

agent = AsyncAgent(provider, model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
                   tools=default_registry(), permissions=ask_the_owner)
```

`request.reason` is what the model reads in place of the default
`Permission denied by user.` — a sentence that is only true when there
was a user. Plain (non-async) gates keep working in both agents
unchanged; the synchronous `Agent` rejects an async gate outright rather
than treating the coroutine it gets back as a yes. See
[notes/37](notes/37-a-gate-that-can-wait.md).

A gate that waits needs a clock, and the clock does not get to decide
what your silence meant — so `on_timeout` has no default:

```python
from yantra import with_deadline

gate = with_deadline(ask_the_owner, 30, on_timeout="deny")   # a deploy
gate = with_deadline(ask_the_owner, 30, on_timeout="allow")  # a nightly batch
gate = with_deadline(ask_the_owner, 30)                      # TypeError
```

On expiry the pending question is **cancelled**, so a chat window can
withdraw it instead of offering Approve for a call that can no longer
happen. A turn cancelled from outside still raises rather than becoming a
denial: nobody said no. A deadline binds only a gate that *suspends* — a
plain function has already answered by the time a clock could start.

Every refusal also carries a short machine token beside the sentence, so
a host can branch without matching on English:

```python
for event in agent.run_streaming("tidy up the logs"):
    if isinstance(event, ToolExecuted) and event.refusal is not None:
        metrics.increment(f"refused.{event.refusal}")   # timeout / user / ...
```

`user`, `unattended`, `timeout`, `policy`, `unspecified` ship here; the
field is a plain string, so a host names its own. The token never reaches
the model, and `refuse(request, reason, code=...)` — which always returns
`False` — is how a gate writes both at once. See
[notes/39](notes/39-a-clock-and-a-word.md).

Two more things matter only if your process does not exit. A provider
owns two HTTP connection pools and gives them back on request — one file
descriptor per provider, otherwise, for as long as the process lives:

```python
provider.close()                 # the sync pool
await provider.aclose()          # both (an AsyncClient needs a live loop)

with get_provider("anthropic", load_settings("anthropic")) as provider:
    ...                          # async with ... also works
```

And a checkpoint holds two different things: the conversation
(`history`, `total_usage`) and the agent's identity (`provider`, `model`,
`system`, `max_iterations`). `/load` at a keyboard wants both.

```python
apply_payload(agent, payload, history_only=True)   # conversation only
```

A host that rebuilds its agent every turn from a package on disk wants
only the conversation — its identity comes from the package, which may
have been edited since the checkpoint was written. See
[notes/38](notes/38-giving-it-back.md).

runs to completion in the same event loop — and refuses with a sentence
the model quotes back),
[`examples/gate_deadline_demo.py`](examples/gate_deadline_demo.py) (the
same absent owner and the same question twice, `on_timeout="deny"` then
`"allow"` — one word apart, opposite outcomes, and the host reading the
refusal code off the event stream).

## Agent packages

An agent is a **directory**, so it can be named, versioned, reviewed and
handed to someone:

```
researcher/
├── agent.toml      identity · model · tools · skills · servers · policy
├── prompt.md       the system prompt
├── tools/          Tool subclasses this agent brings with it
├── skills/         procedures this agent knows
├── subagents/      prompts for the children it delegates to
└── evals/          the cases that say it still works
```

```bash
uv run yantra --agent ./researcher "what changed in notes/30 recently?"
uv run yantra --agent ./researcher --provider ollama   # against your own hardware
cd researcher && uv run yantra                         # ./agent.toml is found
```

A worked example ships in
[examples/agents/researcher](examples/agents/researcher) — a read-only
research agent with its own skill and its own tool. The full format and
the reasoning behind it are [notes/31](notes/31-agent-packages.md).

The smallest package that works is two lines:

```toml
[agent]
name = "tiny"
```

**Every field is optional, and that is the portability promise.** Flags
beat the manifest, the manifest beats the environment, the environment
beats the built-in default:

```
command line   >   agent.toml   >   environment   >   built-in default
```

So a package you wrote against Anthropic runs on somebody else's Ollama
box with `--provider ollama` and *their* model — no fork, no diff to
maintain, no edit to your file.

```toml
[agent]
name        = "researcher"
description = "Reads sources and answers with citations."
version     = "0.1.0"

[model]
max_iterations = 20             # provider/model left open on purpose

[tools]
allow = ["read_file", "glob", "grep", "web_fetch", "load_skill"]
deny  = ["browser_*"]           # fnmatch, like $YANTRA_DISABLED_TOOLS
dirs  = ["tools"]               # your own tools; ./tools is found anyway

[budget]
max_usd_per_turn = 0.50         # a STOP, not a cap (notes/34)

[permissions]
mode = "ask"                    # ask | yolo

[env]
context = "local"               # off | local | full
```

A package may also declare the children it delegates to:

```toml
[[subagent]]
name        = "fact_checker"
description = "Check one claim against the files here."   # the model reads this
prompt      = "subagents/fact_checker.md"                 # or instructions = "..."
tools       = ["read_file", "glob", "grep"]               # NARROWER than the parent
max_iterations = 12
```

The model then calls `fact_checker(task="...")` — one string, and nothing
else. It does not choose the child's tools, its prompt or its iteration
cap, which is the whole difference from `spawn_subagent`, where it
chooses all three at call time and needs an operator flag to be allowed
to. The child gets a fresh context window; the parent gets back only its
final answer. See [notes/40](notes/40-a-package-that-delegates.md).

`allow`/`deny` are a **standing admission policy**, not a one-time sweep:
they also govern tools registered later — `ask_user`, `load_skill`, an MCP
server's tools — so an agent that says it does not get `bash` never gets
bash. A non-empty `allow` is a complete whitelist, MCP tools included
(say `mcp__*` if you want them).

### Your own tools

A package is not limited to the sixteen built-ins. Drop a `Tool` subclass
into `tools/` and it loads with the agent:

```python
# researcher/tools/outline.py
from yantra.tools.base import Tool, require_str
from yantra.tools.fs import resolve_in_sandbox        # same fence read_file uses

class Outline(Tool):
    name = "outline"
    description = "List the Markdown headings of a file with line numbers..."
    parameters = {"type": "object", ...}              # hand-written, on purpose
    read_only = True                                  # auto-approves; your word

    def summary(self, args, ctx): return f"outline: {args.get('path')}"
    def run(self, args, ctx): ...
```

```
$ uv run yantra --agent ./researcher "outline notes/30-skills.md at depth 1"
agent: researcher 0.1.0 -- ./researcher
package tools: outline
```

Three things worth knowing before you run somebody else's package:
**loading `tools/` runs their Python as you**, before any permission gate
— so package paths come from your command line, never from a message or a
model; `read_only = True` is the author's word and nothing checks it; and
a package tool that shadows a built-in raises instead of quietly becoming
`bash`. There is deliberately **no `@tool` decorator** — the hand-written
schema is what makes the model call your tool correctly, and generating
one from type hints throws that away.
[notes/32](notes/32-package-tools.md) argues all of it.

**Unknown keys are errors.** A misspelled `deny` that quietly left `bash`
armed would be the worst bug this format could have:

```
$ uv run yantra --agent ./broken
error: ./broken/agent.toml: unknown key(s) in [tools]: alow
       (known: allow, deny, dirs, per_turn)
```

### The package's own acceptance gate

Running somebody's package means running their prompt, their tool list
and their Python. "It works, I promise" is not evidence, so a package
ships the cases that say so, and one command turns them into an exit
code:

```
$ uv run yantra --agent examples/agents/researcher --eval --provider ollama
eval researcher 0.1.0 · 4 case(s) · 1 roster-only · ollama · qwen3.8-64k:latest
cwd: .../examples/agents/researcher
gate: read-only tools only; writes and commands are refused (--yolo opens it)
budget: $0.50 per turn -- inert here, a local model bills nothing

  PASS  outlines-before-reading  15.4s · 7716 tok · 3 it · outline, read_file
  PASS  cites-what-it-read  34.7s · 9337 tok · 3 it · list_dir, glob, read_file
  PASS  cannot-write-even-when-asked  21.8s · 5249 tok · 2 it · read_file, list_dir
  PASS  has-no-way-to-write  roster only · no model call · 0 tok

SUITE GREEN · 4/4 passed · 22302 tokens · 1 case(s) cost nothing
```

A case is TOML; `check` is the one hatch to Python, resolved against the
package's own `evals/graders.py`:

```toml
[[case]]
id = "outlines-before-reading"
user_message = "Which section of SKILL.md covers confidence, and on what line?"
required_tools = ["outline"]          # what ACTUALLY executed, not what was offered
forbidden_tools = ["bash"]
check = "graders:names_a_line_number" # (str) -> bool, optional
max_tokens = 30_000
max_iterations = 8
min_pass_rate = 0.7                   # "holds seven runs in ten" -- see --repeat
```

**Two kinds of assertion, and only one of them costs money.** The keys
above grade the *trajectory* — what ran — so they need a run. `has_tools`
and `lacks_tools` grade the *roster*: the tools the agent is offered at
all, which is knowable the moment it is built. That is the claim
`forbidden_tools` cannot make (a tool that was available and went unused
looks exactly like one that was absent), it takes fnmatch patterns because
a roster is a set, and a case that asserts nothing else needs no
`user_message`:

```toml
[[case]]
id = "has-no-way-to-write"
lacks_tools = ["write_file", "edit_file", "bash", "browser_*"]
has_tools   = ["read_file", "glob", "outline"]
```

Zero tokens, no model call, and a roster failure stops the case before a
request goes out — a trajectory from an agent with the wrong tool list
belongs to some other agent. Patterns are refused in `required_tools` /
`forbidden_tools`, where they would match nothing and quietly pass.

**Zero tokens now means zero setup.** A run whose selected cases are all
roster ones resolves no provider at all — no key, no `.env`, no local
server, which is what makes this affordable on every push:

```
$ uv run yantra --agent ./researcher --eval --case "has-no-way*"
eval researcher 0.1.0 · 1 case(s) · 1 roster-only · none · (no model needed)
no provider resolved: every selected case grades the roster, so this run
makes no request and needs no key
filtered: has-no-way* -- 1 of 6 case(s); this is not the package's gate

  PASS  has-no-way-to-write  roster only · no model call · 0 tok

SUBSET GREEN · 1/1 passed · 5 case(s) not run · 0 tokens
```

`--case PATTERN` (fnmatch, repeatable) is how you aim `--repeat` at the
one case that needs the evidence instead of paying for it on every
deterministic one — `--case "flaky-*" --repeat 10`. A filtered run says
**SUBSET**, never SUITE: a green line under a filter is a claim about the
cases that ran, and that line is what ends up in a pull request.

**A run can be written down, so the next one has something to answer.**

```
$ uv run yantra --agent . --eval --model gemma4:12b --against runs/qwen.json
SUITE GREEN · 6/6 passed · 24862 tokens · 2 case(s) cost nothing

against researcher 0.1.0 on ollama/qwen3.8:latest, 2026-09-17T02:33:29Z (6/6 passed)
different model: ollama/qwen3.8:latest → ollama/gemma4:12b
  no case changed verdict or pass count
tokens: 34991 → 24862 (-10129)
```

`--report FILE` writes the run as JSON (red runs included — that is the
one you compare against tomorrow); `--against FILE` says what moved. It
changes **no verdict and no exit code**: a run that got worse and is still
green is still green. Cases are compared as counts (`7/10 → 6/10`, never
percentages), a case present in only one run shows as `added`/`gone`
rather than being intersected away, and comparing two different models is
the point rather than an error. See
[notes/42](notes/42-two-runs-of-the-same-suite.md).

**The servers the package declares are under test too.** `--eval` starts
them and their tools register as `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, so
`has_tools = ["mcp__docs__*"]` grades something real instead of an empty
set. A declared server the suite cannot reach exits 2 rather than grading
a smaller agent than the one that ships; `--no-mcp` skips them for offline
CI and says loudly that it did.

**One run is one sample.** A trajectory is a die roll, so `--repeat N`
runs every case N times and judges it on the rate; `min_pass_rate` in the
file is the author's claim ("7 of 10"), and how many runs to buy is the
operator's money, so `repeat` is deliberately not a key:

```
$ uv run yantra --agent ./researcher --eval --repeat 4 --provider ollama
  FAIL  outlines-before-reading  ✗✗✓✓ 2/4 runs (needs 4) · 54.2s · 22862 tok
        required tool not used: outline (2 of 4 runs)
```

Two of four, on a case that passes if you run it once and are lucky. The
glyphs are there because `2/4` hides which runs failed, and the count on
the failure line separates a flaky prompt from a broken one.

`--async N` drives the same suite through `AsyncEvalRunner`, N
trajectories at once, with identical grading — a flag worth having against
a metered provider and close to a wash against one local model on one GPU
([notes/35](notes/35-roster-and-pass-rates.md) has the measured numbers).

Three rules hold the gate up. The cases are graded against **the package
itself** — its prompt, skills, package tools and admission policy, built
the way a real session builds them — so the verdict is about the agent
you would actually run. A case **may not replace the system prompt**
(`system` is refused as a key): that would grade some other agent. And a
suite **never asks and cannot open its own gate** — read-only tools
auto-approve, everything else is refused until *you* pass `--yolo`, and
the package's own `permissions.mode` is ignored so an author cannot ship
their way past it.

Graders resolve while the file is read, never mid-run — a typo that
costs six cases' worth of tokens to discover is a bug in the gate, not
in your package:

```
error: .../evals/cases.toml: case 'cites-what-it-read'.check: graders.py
       defines no 'cites_a_url' (it defines: cites_a_file, names_a_line_number)
```

Non-zero exit on any failure, so CI needs nothing else.
[notes/33](notes/33-evals-as-a-gate.md) has the reasoning, including what
a trajectory check honestly cannot see;
[notes/35](notes/35-roster-and-pass-rates.md) is the assertion that can see
it, plus the arithmetic of grading a die roll.

Embedding it instead of running it:

```python
from yantra import load_package, yolo

spec = load_package("./researcher")
agent = spec.build(permissions=yolo)          # or spec.build_async(...)
reply = agent.run("what changed in notes/30?")
print(reply.message.text())
```

`AgentSpec` owns the assembly order — admission policy before any tool is
registered, prompt layers before `env_context` appends to them, skills
before the tool catalog. `Agent.__init__` still takes its seventeen
arguments for anyone who wants them.

### A ceiling in dollars

`max_iterations` caps how many round trips a turn may take, which is a
patience limit, not a spending limit: twenty-five cheap iterations and
twenty-five expensive ones are the same number and differ by two orders of
magnitude on the invoice. So a turn may also carry a ceiling in the unit
of the bill:

```toml
[budget]
max_usd_per_turn = 0.50
```

```bash
yantra --agent ./researcher --max-usd 0.50 "summarise the notes directory"
```

The meter is read **between iterations**, so it is a stop and not a cap —
the only way to learn what a model call cost is to make it, and the
overshoot is bounded by exactly one call:

```
── turn ended: over_budget -- spent ~$0.0785 of the $0.02 ceiling for this turn
   (after 3 iteration(s))
```

You get one heads-up before that, priced from the request the agent is
about to send rather than from what it has already spent:

```
· budget: the next call carries ~11,189 tokens of context, about $0.0336 before
the reply -- and ~$0.0003 is left of the $0.02 ceiling for this turn
```

The percentage version of that warning does not work, and
[notes/36](notes/36-a-warning-before-the-stop.md) measures why: a tool
result lands in the context and the next call costs four times the last
one, so a turn goes from 58% of its ceiling to 145% in a single step
without ever being seen inside the band. The forecast is an estimate, on
purpose — the *stop* is only ever made on money actually billed, and a
warning that is wrong costs a line of text.

The rules worth knowing before you rely on it:

* **Per turn, not per session.** One turn is one thing the agent was asked
  to do, and it is the only unit a package author can honestly estimate.
* **A final answer is never discarded.** Crossing the line on the reply
  itself gets you the reply; the money is spent either way. Only *further
  tool calls* are refused.
* **Sub-agents share the meter.** A child charges its parent's ceiling
  rather than getting a fresh one, or delegating would be the cheap way
  around it.
* **Local models bill nothing**, so the ceiling is inert and says so:
  `budget: $0.50 per turn -- inert here, a local model bills nothing`.
  Give your own Ollama tag a price in `$YANTRA_PRICES` and it becomes
  real — which is how you rehearse a ceiling without pointing it at an
  account with a card behind it.
* **A metered model nobody can price refuses to carry a ceiling**, before
  a token is spent, rather than quietly metering $0.00:
  `error: budget: no list price is known for 'gizmo-9', so a $0.50 ceiling
  could never stop anything.`
* **A sub-agent never spends the turn's one warning.** It shares the
  meter, but its events go into a tool result rather than to your screen,
  so the heads-up surfaces on the parent's next iteration instead.
* **`--max-usd` overrides the package, up or down.** Unlike `tools.deny`,
  which the command line cannot lift: a restriction you cannot lift is a
  security control, a number you can lift is a guard rail.
* **`--budget-notice` tells the AGENT too**, once, at the same moment —
  so it finishes with what it has instead of being cut off mid-thought.
  It is told the **deadline**, never the figures: a model handed a number
  to optimise starts trimming the answer or budgeting its own calls, and
  neither is the work. Off by default, and the operator's call rather than
  the package author's, because it changes how the model behaves. The
  notice is *sent*, never written to history — it is true of one turn, and
  history gets replayed.
* **The browser draws what is left.** The header carries a budget bar
  beside the context-pressure one — same widget, same thresholds — showing
  `$0.07 left` rather than what has been spent, and moving mid-turn rather
  than at the end. An inert ceiling shows empty and `free`, because a full
  bar that can never move looks like protection.

[notes/34](notes/34-budgets.md) has the reasoning, the receipts, and what
is deliberately still missing;
[notes/36](notes/36-a-warning-before-the-stop.md) is the warning, and the
version of it that had to be thrown away first;
[notes/43](notes/43-a-bar-and-a-deadline.md) is the bar and the deadline —
the two readers of the same meter, wanting opposite things.

## Architecture

Normalization happens in exactly ONE layer: the provider adapters.
Internal types are the only representation the rest of the program sees.

Design rules worth stealing:

* **Errors are data.** A crashing/denied/nonexistent tool becomes an
  `is_error` tool result the model reads and recovers from; the loop
  cannot be crashed by a tool. Provider errors (auth/rate-limit/overflow)
  are the opposite: exceptions, terminal for the turn. A third family,
  `UserUnavailable`, is deliberately neither — a `BaseException` that
  fails the turn when `ask_user` runs with no human attached, because
  no error message could teach the model to conjure a user.
* **The history invariant:** every tool_call id gets a matching result
  before the next request — enforced on every exit path including
  iteration caps and mid-turn Ctrl-C ([notes/05](notes/05-agent-loop.md)).
* **Permission gate = plain callable** `Callable[[PermissionRequest], bool]`.
  Tools build their own human-readable `summary()` with the same context
  execution will get, so what you approve is what runs. Approve-with-edits
  falls out of one deliberate mutability: a gate may REPLACE
  `request.arguments` before answering True; the loop notices the swap by
  identity and adopts the edited form — so approval is a review step, not
  a rubber stamp ([notes/20](notes/20-approve-with-edits.md)).
* **Gates decide, hooks watch.** Observational `on_before_tool` /
  `on_after_tool` callbacks bracket every real execution (errors
  included) but can veto nothing — denial stays the gate's job. A
  raising hook crashes the turn loudly: hooks are developer
  infrastructure, not untrusted input ([notes/14](notes/14-hooks.md)).
* **Two channels out of a turn.** Raw StreamEvents (text/thinking
  deltas) are *pushed* to `agent.on_stream_event` while each response
  streams (collect() owns the pull, so they can't be yielded);
  ToolExecuted/TurnEnd are *yielded* from `run_streaming()`. Consumers
  pull, UIs subscribe ([notes/05](notes/05-agent-loop.md)).
* **Retry the opening, never the stream.** 429/5xx/connection errors
  back off with jitter up to hard budgets; once one event reached the
  caller there is no safe replay ([notes/07](notes/07-reliability-and-scale.md)).
* **Gates sequential, execution parallel.** y/n prompts own the
  terminal; approved batches run in a thread pool (or as asyncio tasks)
  but results yield in submission order. Ctrl-C mid-batch records REAL
  results — workers finish during the join, and the work happened
  (async needs `asyncio.shield` for this: a bare `await gather`
  forwards cancellation INTO its children and loses finished work,
  [notes/11](notes/11-async.md)).
* **Mask before summarize.** Compaction first elides old tool-result
  OUTPUT (reversible, calls stay verbatim); only if still in the red
  zone does an LLM summarize the middle — goal message intact, every
  tool call accounted for ([notes/07](notes/07-reliability-and-scale.md)).
* **Tool results are strings — until pixels.** A tool may return a
  `ToolOutput` (text + images); the loop splits it and HOISTS the
  images onto history after the results, because two of the three wire
  dialects cannot carry an image inside a tool payload at all. One
  transcript shape everywhere; adapters never see the field
  ([notes/27](notes/27-read-image.md)).
* **Sub-agents: constrained in code, not prompts.** One level deep
  (`spawn_subagent` rejected from child catalogs), bounded (per-session
  budget + mandatory justification), compact results (conclusions +
  cost metadata, never transcripts). Scope restriction lives at the
  ToolRegistry level; permissions are inherited so a sub-agent cannot
  escalate by being a sub-agent ([notes/08](notes/08-sub-agents.md)). A
  package may DECLARE a child instead, and then the author owns its tool
  list rather than the model — which also makes "does this need a
  permission prompt?" answerable, so a child that can only read does not
  ask ([notes/40](notes/40-a-package-that-delegates.md)).
* **Sync generators everywhere** — blocking tools, blocking REPL, and
  cancellation for free (generator close unwinds into socket cleanup).
* **Async = cores + skins, not a rewrite.** Protocol logic lives in
  incremental sync classes (SSE framing, stream routers, response
  folding, compaction arithmetic); `acollect`/`astream`/`AsyncAgent`
  are thin awaited skins over the same rules — zero duplicated wire
  logic. Tools keep ONE blocking implementation; the async loop pushes
  them to threads via a default `arun()` (`to_thread`) instead of
  pretending syscalls are non-blocking. One event loop drives K
  independent conversations ([notes/11](notes/11-async.md)).

## The wire cheat-sheet

The whole reason three adapters exist. Same conversation, three encodings:

| Concern | Anthropic Messages | OpenAI chat-completions | OpenAI Responses |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auth | `x-api-key` + `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01` | `Authorization: Bearer` | `Authorization: Bearer` |
| Endpoint | `POST {base}/v1/messages` | `POST {base}/chat/completions` | `POST {base}/responses` |
| System prompt | top-level `"system"` field | `messages[0] role:"system"` | top-level `"instructions"` field |
| max_tokens | **required** | optional | `max_output_tokens` (optional) |
| History shape | block-shaped messages | role messages; user turns fan out into `role:"tool"` messages | ONE flat `input[]` of TYPED items (`message`, `function_call`, `function_call_output`) |
| Tool definition | `{name, description, input_schema}` | `{type:"function", function:{name, description, parameters}}` | FLAT: `{type:"function", name, description, parameters}` |
| Tool calls in reply | content blocks `type:"tool_use"` (input = object) | `message.tool_calls[]` (arguments = JSON **string**) | `output[]` items `type:"function_call"`, keyed by `call_id` (arguments = JSON **string**) |
| Sending results back | next `role:"user"` msg w/ `tool_result` blocks | one `role:"tool"` message per call | one `type:"function_call_output"` item per result (echoes `call_id`) |
| Stop signal | `stop_reason: end_turn\|tool_use\|max_tokens...` | `finish_reason: stop\|length\|tool_calls\|content_filter` | `status: completed\|incomplete` (+ any `function_call` item ⇒ tool_use; `incomplete_details.reason: max_output_tokens`) |
| Model reasoning | content blocks `type:"thinking"` + opaque `signature` — MUST round-trip verbatim in tool loops; `type:"redacted_thinking"` (ciphertext) has the same contract and arrives whole in streams | `reasoning` / `reasoning_content` fields — display-only | `reasoning` output items / summary deltas — display-only |
| Stream shape | named events (`message_start`, `content_block_start/delta/stop`, `message_delta`, `message_stop`, `ping`) | anonymous chunks ending `data: [DONE]`; empty-choices chunks carry usage | named events (`response.created`, `response.output_text.delta`, `response.function_call_arguments.delta`, terminal `response.completed` carrying usage) ending `data: [DONE]` |

Streaming details both formats share: arguments arrive as **fragments**
that must accumulate keyed by stream index and parse exactly once at the
end ([notes/03](notes/03-sse-and-collect.md)).

The offline suite never touches the network: adapters run against
byte-exact SSE/JSON fixtures via `httpx.MockTransport`; the loop runs
against `ScriptedProvider`. The integration suite
(`tests/test_integration.py`) drives real adapters through a full
two-iteration tool turn per provider and asserts each wire's
result-encoding shape on the second request.


## Tested

`uv run pytest -q` — 1346 offline tests against byte-exact SSE/JSON
fixtures (`httpx.MockTransport`) and a `ScriptedProvider` loop: no
network, no key. Retries are exercised offline too, against flaky
mock transports whose policy path is identical to the live one. The
browser UI runs fully offline as well: FastAPI's test client drives the
real routes against scripted turns — and web_fetch does the same trick
with a mocked transport behind its real request path. The browser_*
family goes further and stays green in BOTH worlds: without playwright
(fakes carry the session) and with the extra synced.

The suite is sealed off from the machine it runs on: a `conftest.py`
fixture latches the `.env` loader shut and clears every `YANTRA_*` and
provider variable, so the result never depends on whose keys happen to
be lying around. Warnings are failures (`filterwarnings = ["error"]`),
`ResourceWarning` included — which is what keeps descriptors and child
processes honest. Enforcing it caught three leaks that had been quietly
accumulating: the parent's copy of every background job's log fd, the
read pipe behind every MCP stdio server, and a `SIGKILL` with no
`wait()` after it. Test teardown moved into fixtures on the same pass,
so a suite that spawns real bash jobs and real servers can no longer
leave them running past the test that asked for them.

`uv run ruff check .` lints on a deliberately narrow rule set — `F`/`B`
for the bug-shaped mistakes, `E`/`W`/`UP` to keep the style honest.
Import ORDER is left alone: imports here are grouped to read top-down,
and shuffling them alphabetically would cost readability for no
correctness gain.

Everything above has also been exercised against real providers —
all three dialects via OpenRouter (cloud models) plus local Ollama
for end-to-end runs of sandboxing, build mode, MCP, sub-agents,
evals, caching, hooks, vision, `ask_user`, the web UI, and the
self-reliance set (background jobs + a localhost web_fetch + todo
tracking on `qwen3.8`; `read_image` vision on `gemma4:12b` — see the
receipts closing notes/24–27), and the browser_* family driving a
JavaScript-rendered local page end to end on `qwen3.8` — a page
web_fetch provably cannot read ([notes/28](notes/28-browser-tools.md)). The
`examples/` demos rerun most of it on demand. Live testing shook out
four real bugs along the way, all fixed and now regression-tested:
gateway `null` token counters poisoning `Usage.add()`, an orphaned
child process when Ctrl-C lands mid-bash, thinking blocks that must
round-trip verbatim through tool loops (including unsigned ones behind
a gateway that still validates the field), and an inverted
yolo-warning guard in the banner ([notes/02](notes/02-wire-formats.md),
[notes/04](notes/04-tools.md), [notes/06](notes/06-cli.md)). Building
the web layer shook out three more: SQLite connections used from the
server thread without `check_same_thread=False` (every save 500'd) and
a permission gate that popped approval modals for read-only tools —
both caught by its tests before they could ship — plus one that did
ship and was caught in use: the context meter pegged at 100% on small
local windows, where the reply budget exceeded an 8k ollama window and
clamped usable space to one token ([notes/22](notes/22-web-ui.md)).
